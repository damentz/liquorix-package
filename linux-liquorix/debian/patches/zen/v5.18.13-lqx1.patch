+=========================================
+Processor MMIO Stale Data Vulnerabilities
+=========================================
+
+Processor MMIO Stale Data Vulnerabilities are a class of memory-mapped I/O
+(MMIO) vulnerabilities that can expose data. The sequences of operations for
+exposing data range from simple to very complex. Because most of the
+vulnerabilities require the attacker to have access to MMIO, many environments
+are not affected. System environments using virtualization where MMIO access is
+provided to untrusted guests may need mitigation. These vulnerabilities are
+not transient execution attacks. However, these vulnerabilities may propagate
+stale data into core fill buffers where the data can subsequently be inferred
+by an unmitigated transient execution attack. Mitigation for these
+vulnerabilities includes a combination of microcode update and software
+changes, depending on the platform and usage model. Some of these mitigations
+are similar to those used to mitigate Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) or
+those used to mitigate Special Register Buffer Data Sampling (SRBDS).
+
+Data Propagators
+================
+Propagators are operations that result in stale data being copied or moved from
+one microarchitectural buffer or register to another. Processor MMIO Stale Data
+Vulnerabilities are operations that may result in stale data being directly
+read into an architectural, software-visible state or sampled from a buffer or
+register.
+
+Fill Buffer Stale Data Propagator (FBSDP)
+-----------------------------------------
+Stale data may propagate from fill buffers (FB) into the non-coherent portion
+of the uncore on some non-coherent writes. Fill buffer propagation by itself
+does not make stale data architecturally visible. Stale data must be propagated
+to a location where it is subject to reading or sampling.
+
+Sideband Stale Data Propagator (SSDP)
+-------------------------------------
+The sideband stale data propagator (SSDP) is limited to the client (including
+Intel Xeon server E3) uncore implementation. The sideband response buffer is
+shared by all client cores. For non-coherent reads that go to sideband
+destinations, the uncore logic returns 64 bytes of data to the core, including
+both requested data and unrequested stale data, from a transaction buffer and
+the sideband response buffer. As a result, stale data from the sideband
+response and transaction buffers may now reside in a core fill buffer.
+
+Primary Stale Data Propagator (PSDP)
+------------------------------------
+The primary stale data propagator (PSDP) is limited to the client (including
+Intel Xeon server E3) uncore implementation. Similar to the sideband response
+buffer, the primary response buffer is shared by all client cores. For some
+processors, MMIO primary reads will return 64 bytes of data to the core fill
+buffer including both requested data and unrequested stale data. This is
+similar to the sideband stale data propagator.
+
+Vulnerabilities
+===============
+Device Register Partial Write (DRPW) (CVE-2022-21166)
+-----------------------------------------------------
+Some endpoint MMIO registers incorrectly handle writes that are smaller than
+the register size. Instead of aborting the write or only copying the correct
+subset of bytes (for example, 2 bytes for a 2-byte write), more bytes than
+specified by the write transaction may be written to the register. On
+processors affected by FBSDP, this may expose stale data from the fill buffers
+of the core that created the write transaction.
+
+Shared Buffers Data Sampling (SBDS) (CVE-2022-21125)
+----------------------------------------------------
+After propagators may have moved data around the uncore and copied stale data
+into client core fill buffers, processors affected by MFBDS can leak data from
+the fill buffer. It is limited to the client (including Intel Xeon server E3)
+uncore implementation.
+
+Shared Buffers Data Read (SBDR) (CVE-2022-21123)
+------------------------------------------------
+It is similar to Shared Buffer Data Sampling (SBDS) except that the data is
+directly read into the architectural software-visible state. It is limited to
+the client (including Intel Xeon server E3) uncore implementation.
+
+Affected Processors
+===================
+Not all the CPUs are affected by all the variants. For instance, most
+processors for the server market (excluding Intel Xeon E3 processors) are
+impacted by only Device Register Partial Write (DRPW).
+
+Below is the list of affected Intel processors [#f1]_:

+
+If a CPU is in the affected processor list, but not affected by a variant, it
+is indicated by new bits in MSR IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES. As described in a later
+section, mitigation largely remains the same for all the variants, i.e. to
+clear the CPU fill buffers via VERW instruction.
+
+New bits in MSRs
+================
+Newer processors and microcode update on existing affected processors added new
+bits to IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR. These bits can be used to enumerate
+specific variants of Processor MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities and mitigation
+capability.
+
+MSR IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES
+--------------------------
+Bit 13 - SBDR_SSDP_NO - When set, processor is not affected by either the
+	 Shared Buffers Data Read (SBDR) vulnerability or the sideband stale
+	 data propagator (SSDP).
+Bit 14 - FBSDP_NO - When set, processor is not affected by the Fill Buffer
+	 Stale Data Propagator (FBSDP).
+Bit 15 - PSDP_NO - When set, processor is not affected by Primary Stale Data
+	 Propagator (PSDP).
+Bit 17 - FB_CLEAR - When set, VERW instruction will overwrite CPU fill buffer
+	 values as part of MD_CLEAR operations. Processors that do not
+	 enumerate MDS_NO (meaning they are affected by MDS) but that do
+	 enumerate support for both L1D_FLUSH and MD_CLEAR implicitly enumerate
+	 FB_CLEAR as part of their MD_CLEAR support.
+Bit 18 - FB_CLEAR_CTRL - Processor supports read and write to MSR
+	 IA32_MCU_OPT_CTRL[FB_CLEAR_DIS]. On such processors, the FB_CLEAR_DIS
+	 bit can be set to cause the VERW instruction to not perform the
+	 FB_CLEAR action. Not all processors that support FB_CLEAR will support
+	 FB_CLEAR_CTRL.
+
+MSR IA32_MCU_OPT_CTRL
+---------------------
+Bit 3 - FB_CLEAR_DIS - When set, VERW instruction does not perform the FB_CLEAR
+action. This may be useful to reduce the performance impact of FB_CLEAR in
+cases where system software deems it warranted (for example, when performance
+is more critical, or the untrusted software has no MMIO access). Note that
+FB_CLEAR_DIS has no impact on enumeration (for example, it does not change
+FB_CLEAR or MD_CLEAR enumeration) and it may not be supported on all processors
+that enumerate FB_CLEAR.
+
+Mitigation
+==========
+Like MDS, all variants of Processor MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities  have the
+same mitigation strategy to force the CPU to clear the affected buffers before
+an attacker can extract the secrets.
+
+This is achieved by using the otherwise unused and obsolete VERW instruction in
+combination with a microcode update. The microcode clears the affected CPU
+buffers when the VERW instruction is executed.
+
+Kernel reuses the MDS function to invoke the buffer clearing:
+
+	mds_clear_cpu_buffers()
+
+On MDS affected CPUs, the kernel already invokes CPU buffer clear on
+kernel/userspace, hypervisor/guest and C-state (idle) transitions. No
+additional mitigation is needed on such CPUs.
+
+For CPUs not affected by MDS or TAA, mitigation is needed only for the attacker
+with MMIO capability. Therefore, VERW is not required for kernel/userspace. For
+virtualization case, VERW is only needed at VMENTER for a guest with MMIO
+capability.
+
+Mitigation points
+-----------------
+Return to user space
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+Same mitigation as MDS when affected by MDS/TAA, otherwise no mitigation
+needed.
+
+C-State transition
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+Control register writes by CPU during C-state transition can propagate data
+from fill buffer to uncore buffers. Execute VERW before C-state transition to
+clear CPU fill buffers.
+
+Guest entry point
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+Same mitigation as MDS when processor is also affected by MDS/TAA, otherwise
+execute VERW at VMENTER only for MMIO capable guests. On CPUs not affected by
+MDS/TAA, guest without MMIO access cannot extract secrets using Processor MMIO
+Stale Data vulnerabilities, so there is no need to execute VERW for such guests.
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line
+---------------------------------------------
+The kernel command line allows to control the Processor MMIO Stale Data
+mitigations at boot time with the option "mmio_stale_data=". The valid
+arguments for this option are:
+
+  ==========  =================================================================
+  full        If the CPU is vulnerable, enable mitigation; CPU buffer clearing
+              on exit to userspace and when entering a VM. Idle transitions are
+              protected as well. It does not automatically disable SMT.
+  full,nosmt  Same as full, with SMT disabled on vulnerable CPUs. This is the
+              complete mitigation.
+  off         Disables mitigation completely.
+  ==========  =================================================================
+
+If the CPU is affected and mmio_stale_data=off is not supplied on the kernel
+command line, then the kernel selects the appropriate mitigation.
+
+Mitigation status information
+-----------------------------
+The Linux kernel provides a sysfs interface to enumerate the current
+vulnerability status of the system: whether the system is vulnerable, and
+which mitigations are active. The relevant sysfs file is:
+
+	/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mmio_stale_data
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - 'Not affected'
+       - The processor is not vulnerable
+     * - 'Vulnerable'
+       - The processor is vulnerable, but no mitigation enabled
+     * - 'Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode'
+       - The processor is vulnerable, but microcode is not updated. The
+         mitigation is enabled on a best effort basis.
+     * - 'Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers'
+       - The processor is vulnerable and the CPU buffer clearing mitigation is
+         enabled.
+
+If the processor is vulnerable then the following information is appended to
+the above information:
+
+  ========================  ===========================================
+  'SMT vulnerable'          SMT is enabled
+  'SMT disabled'            SMT is disabled
+  'SMT Host state unknown'  Kernel runs in a VM, Host SMT state unknown

+Multi-Gen LRU
+=============
+The multi-gen LRU is an alternative LRU implementation that optimizes
+page reclaim and improves performance under memory pressure. Page
+reclaim decides the kernel's caching policy and ability to overcommit
+memory. It directly impacts the kswapd CPU usage and RAM efficiency.
+
+Quick start
+===========
+Build the kernel with the following configurations.
+
+* ``CONFIG_LRU_GEN=y``
+* ``CONFIG_LRU_GEN_ENABLED=y``
+
+All set!
+
+Runtime options
+===============
+``/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/`` contains stable ABIs described in the
+following subsections.
+
+Kill switch
+-----------
+``enabled`` accepts different values to enable or disable the
+following components. Its default value depends on
+``CONFIG_LRU_GEN_ENABLED``. All the components should be enabled
+unless some of them have unforeseen side effects. Writing to
+``enabled`` has no effect when a component is not supported by the
+hardware, and valid values will be accepted even when the main switch
+is off.
+
+====== ===============================================================
+Values Components
+====== ===============================================================
+0x0001 The main switch for the multi-gen LRU.
+0x0002 Clearing the accessed bit in leaf page table entries in large
+       batches, when MMU sets it (e.g., on x86). This behavior can
+       theoretically worsen lock contention (mmap_lock). If it is
+       disabled, the multi-gen LRU will suffer a minor performance
+       degradation for workloads that contiguously map hot pages,
+       whose accessed bits can be otherwise cleared by fewer larger
+       batches.
+0x0004 Clearing the accessed bit in non-leaf page table entries as
+       well, when MMU sets it (e.g., on x86). This behavior was not
+       verified on x86 varieties other than Intel and AMD. If it is
+       disabled, the multi-gen LRU will suffer a negligible
+       performance degradation.
+[yYnN] Apply to all the components above.
+====== ===============================================================
+
+E.g.,
+::
+
+    echo y >/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    cat /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    0x0007
+    echo 5 >/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    cat /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    0x0005
+
+Thrashing prevention
+--------------------
+Personal computers are more sensitive to thrashing because it can
+cause janks (lags when rendering UI) and negatively impact user
+experience. The multi-gen LRU offers thrashing prevention to the
+majority of laptop and desktop users who do not have ``oomd``.
+
+Users can write ``N`` to ``min_ttl_ms`` to prevent the working set of
+``N`` milliseconds from getting evicted. The OOM killer is triggered
+if this working set cannot be kept in memory. In other words, this
+option works as an adjustable pressure relief valve, and when open, it
+terminates applications that are hopefully not being used.
+
+Based on the average human detectable lag (~100ms), ``N=1000`` usually
+eliminates intolerable janks due to thrashing. Larger values like
+``N=3000`` make janks less noticeable at the risk of premature OOM
+kills.
+
+The default value ``0`` means disabled.
+
+Experimental features
+=====================
+``/sys/kernel/debug/lru_gen`` accepts commands described in the
+following subsections. Multiple command lines are supported, so does
+concatenation with delimiters ``,`` and ``;``.
+
+``/sys/kernel/debug/lru_gen_full`` provides additional stats for
+debugging. ``CONFIG_LRU_GEN_STATS=y`` keeps historical stats from
+evicted generations in this file.
+
+Working set estimation
+----------------------
+Working set estimation measures how much memory an application needs
+in a given time interval, and it is usually done with little impact on
+the performance of the application. E.g., data centers want to
+optimize job scheduling (bin packing) to improve memory utilizations.
+When a new job comes in, the job scheduler needs to find out whether
+each server it manages can allocate a certain amount of memory for
+this new job before it can pick a candidate. To do so, the job
+scheduler needs to estimate the working sets of the existing jobs.
+
+When it is read, ``lru_gen`` returns a histogram of numbers of pages
+accessed over different time intervals for each memcg and node.
+``MAX_NR_GENS`` decides the number of bins for each histogram. The
+histograms are noncumulative.
+::
+
+    memcg  memcg_id  memcg_path
+       node  node_id
+           min_gen_nr  age_in_ms  nr_anon_pages  nr_file_pages
+           ...
+           max_gen_nr  age_in_ms  nr_anon_pages  nr_file_pages
+
+Each bin contains an estimated number of pages that have been accessed
+within ``age_in_ms``. E.g., ``min_gen_nr`` contains the coldest pages
+and ``max_gen_nr`` contains the hottest pages, since ``age_in_ms`` of
+the former is the largest and that of the latter is the smallest.
+
+Users can write ``+ memcg_id node_id max_gen_nr
+[can_swap [force_scan]]`` to ``lru_gen`` to create a new generation
+``max_gen_nr+1``. ``can_swap`` defaults to the swap setting and, if it
+is set to ``1``, it forces the scan of anon pages when swap is off,
+and vice versa. ``force_scan`` defaults to ``1`` and, if it is set to
+``0``, it employs heuristics to reduce the overhead, which is likely
+to reduce the coverage as well.
+
+A typical use case is that a job scheduler writes to ``lru_gen`` at a
+certain time interval to create new generations, and it ranks the
+servers it manages based on the sizes of their cold pages defined by
+this time interval.
+
+Proactive reclaim
+-----------------
+Proactive reclaim induces page reclaim when there is no memory
+pressure. It usually targets cold pages only. E.g., when a new job
+comes in, the job scheduler wants to proactively reclaim cold pages on
+the server it selected to improve the chance of successfully landing
+this new job.
+
+Users can write ``- memcg_id node_id min_gen_nr [swappiness
+[nr_to_reclaim]]`` to ``lru_gen`` to evict generations less than or
+equal to ``min_gen_nr``. Note that ``min_gen_nr`` should be less than
+``max_gen_nr-1`` as ``max_gen_nr`` and ``max_gen_nr-1`` are not fully
+aged and therefore cannot be evicted. ``swappiness`` overrides the
+default value in ``/proc/sys/vm/swappiness``. ``nr_to_reclaim`` limits
+the number of pages to evict.
+
+A typical use case is that a job scheduler writes to ``lru_gen``
+before it tries to land a new job on a server. If it fails to
+materialize enough cold pages because of the overestimation, it
+retries on the next server according to the ranking result obtained
+from the working set estimation step. This less forceful approach
+limits the impacts on the existing jobs.

+
+
+Background
+==========
+
+BitMap Queue CPU scheduler, referred to as BMQ from here on, is an evolution
+of previous Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler(PDS),
+and inspired by Zircon scheduler. The goal of it is to keep the scheduler code
+simple, while efficiency and scalable for interactive tasks, such as desktop,
+movie playback and gaming etc.
+
+Design
+======
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+BMQ use per CPU run queue design, each CPU(logical) has it's own run queue,
+each CPU is responsible for scheduling the tasks that are putting into it's
+run queue.
+
+The run queue is a set of priority queues. Note that these queues are fifo
+queue for non-rt tasks or priority queue for rt tasks in data structure. See
+BitMap Queue below for details. BMQ is optimized for non-rt tasks in the fact
+that most applications are non-rt tasks. No matter the queue is fifo or
+priority, In each queue is an ordered list of runnable tasks awaiting execution
+and the data structures are the same. When it is time for a new task to run,
+the scheduler simply looks the lowest numbered queueue that contains a task,
+and runs the first task from the head of that queue. And per CPU idle task is
+also in the run queue, so the scheduler can always find a task to run on from
+its run queue.
+
+Each task will assigned the same timeslice(default 4ms) when it is picked to
+start running. Task will be reinserted at the end of the appropriate priority
+queue when it uses its whole timeslice. When the scheduler selects a new task
+from the priority queue it sets the CPU's preemption timer for the remainder of
+the previous timeslice. When that timer fires the scheduler will stop execution
+on that task, select another task and start over again.
+
+If a task blocks waiting for a shared resource then it's taken out of its
+priority queue and is placed in a wait queue for the shared resource. When it
+is unblocked it will be reinserted in the appropriate priority queue of an
+eligible CPU.
+
+Task policy
+-----------
+
+BMQ supports DEADLINE, FIFO, RR, NORMAL, BATCH and IDLE task policy like the
+mainline CFS scheduler. But BMQ is heavy optimized for non-rt task, that's
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE policy tasks. Below is the implementation detail of each
+policy.
+
+DEADLINE
+	It is squashed as priority 0 FIFO task.
+
+FIFO/RR
+	All RT tasks share one single priority queue in BMQ run queue designed. The
+complexity of insert operation is O(n). BMQ is not designed for system runs
+with major rt policy tasks.
+
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE
+	BATCH and IDLE tasks are treated as the same policy. They compete CPU with
+NORMAL policy tasks, but they just don't boost. To control the priority of
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE tasks, simply use nice level.
+
+ISO
+	ISO policy is not supported in BMQ. Please use nice level -20 NORMAL policy
+task instead.
+
+Priority management
+-------------------
+
+RT tasks have priority from 0-99. For non-rt tasks, there are three different
+factors used to determine the effective priority of a task. The effective
+priority being what is used to determine which queue it will be in.
+
+The first factor is simply the task’s static priority. Which is assigned from
+task's nice level, within [-20, 19] in userland's point of view and [0, 39]
+internally.
+
+The second factor is the priority boost. This is a value bounded between
+[-MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ, MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ] used to offset the base priority, it is
+modified by the following cases:
+
+*When a thread has used up its entire timeslice, always deboost its boost by
+increasing by one.
+*When a thread gives up cpu control(voluntary or non-voluntary) to reschedule,
+and its switch-in time(time after last switch and run) below the thredhold
+based on its priority boost, will boost its boost by decreasing by one buti is
+capped at 0 (won’t go negative).
+
+The intent in this system is to ensure that interactive threads are serviced
+quickly. These are usually the threads that interact directly with the user
+and cause user-perceivable latency. These threads usually do little work and
+spend most of their time blocked awaiting another user event. So they get the
+priority boost from unblocking while background threads that do most of the
+processing receive the priority penalty for using their entire timeslice.

+Multi-Gen LRU
+=============
+The multi-gen LRU is an alternative LRU implementation that optimizes
+page reclaim and improves performance under memory pressure. Page
+reclaim decides the kernel's caching policy and ability to overcommit
+memory. It directly impacts the kswapd CPU usage and RAM efficiency.
+
+Design overview
+===============
+Objectives
+----------
+The design objectives are:
+
+* Good representation of access recency
+* Try to profit from spatial locality
+* Fast paths to make obvious choices
+* Simple self-correcting heuristics
+
+The representation of access recency is at the core of all LRU
+implementations. In the multi-gen LRU, each generation represents a
+group of pages with similar access recency. Generations establish a
+(time-based) common frame of reference and therefore help make better
+choices, e.g., between different memcgs on a computer or different
+computers in a data center (for job scheduling).
+
+Exploiting spatial locality improves efficiency when gathering the
+accessed bit. A rmap walk targets a single page and does not try to
+profit from discovering a young PTE. A page table walk can sweep all
+the young PTEs in an address space, but the address space can be too
+sparse to make a profit. The key is to optimize both methods and use
+them in combination.
+
+Fast paths reduce code complexity and runtime overhead. Unmapped pages
+do not require TLB flushes; clean pages do not require writeback.
+These facts are only helpful when other conditions, e.g., access
+recency, are similar. With generations as a common frame of reference,
+additional factors stand out. But obvious choices might not be good
+choices; thus self-correction is necessary.
+
+The benefits of simple self-correcting heuristics are self-evident.
+Again, with generations as a common frame of reference, this becomes
+attainable. Specifically, pages in the same generation can be
+categorized based on additional factors, and a feedback loop can
+statistically compare the refault percentages across those categories
+and infer which of them are better choices.
+
+Assumptions
+-----------
+The protection of hot pages and the selection of cold pages are based
+on page access channels and patterns. There are two access channels:
+
+* Accesses through page tables
+* Accesses through file descriptors
+
+The protection of the former channel is by design stronger because:
+
+1. The uncertainty in determining the access patterns of the former
+   channel is higher due to the approximation of the accessed bit.
+2. The cost of evicting the former channel is higher due to the TLB
+   flushes required and the likelihood of encountering the dirty bit.
+3. The penalty of underprotecting the former channel is higher because
+   applications usually do not prepare themselves for major page
+   faults like they do for blocked I/O. E.g., GUI applications
+   commonly use dedicated I/O threads to avoid blocking rendering
+   threads.
+
+There are also two access patterns:
+
+* Accesses exhibiting temporal locality
+* Accesses not exhibiting temporal locality
+
+For the reasons listed above, the former channel is assumed to follow
+the former pattern unless ``VM_SEQ_READ`` or ``VM_RAND_READ`` is
+present, and the latter channel is assumed to follow the latter
+pattern unless outlying refaults have been observed.
+
+Workflow overview
+=================
+Evictable pages are divided into multiple generations for each
+``lruvec``. The youngest generation number is stored in
+``lrugen->max_seq`` for both anon and file types as they are aged on
+an equal footing. The oldest generation numbers are stored in
+``lrugen->min_seq[]`` separately for anon and file types as clean file
+pages can be evicted regardless of swap constraints. These three
+variables are monotonically increasing.
+
+Generation numbers are truncated into ``order_base_2(MAX_NR_GENS+1)``
+bits in order to fit into the gen counter in ``folio->flags``. Each
+truncated generation number is an index to ``lrugen->lists[]``. The
+sliding window technique is used to track at least ``MIN_NR_GENS`` and
+at most ``MAX_NR_GENS`` generations. The gen counter stores a value
+within ``[1, MAX_NR_GENS]`` while a page is on one of
+``lrugen->lists[]``; otherwise it stores zero.
+
+Each generation is divided into multiple tiers. Tiers represent
+different ranges of numbers of accesses through file descriptors. A
+page accessed ``N`` times through file descriptors is in tier
+``order_base_2(N)``. In contrast to moving across generations, which
+requires the LRU lock, moving across tiers only involves atomic
+operations on ``folio->flags`` and therefore has a negligible cost. A
+feedback loop modeled after the PID controller monitors refaults over
+all the tiers from anon and file types and decides which tiers from
+which types to evict or protect.
+
+There are two conceptually independent procedures: the aging and the
+eviction. They form a closed-loop system, i.e., the page reclaim.
+
+Aging
+-----
+The aging produces young generations. Given an ``lruvec``, it
+increments ``max_seq`` when ``max_seq-min_seq+1`` approaches
+``MIN_NR_GENS``. The aging promotes hot pages to the youngest
+generation when it finds them accessed through page tables; the
+demotion of cold pages happens consequently when it increments
+``max_seq``. The aging uses page table walks and rmap walks to find
+young PTEs. For the former, it iterates ``lruvec_memcg()->mm_list``
+and calls ``walk_page_range()`` with each ``mm_struct`` on this list
+to scan PTEs, and after each iteration, it increments ``max_seq``. For
+the latter, when the eviction walks the rmap and finds a young PTE,
+the aging scans the adjacent PTEs. For both, on finding a young PTE,
+the aging clears the accessed bit and updates the gen counter of the
+page mapped by this PTE to ``(max_seq%MAX_NR_GENS)+1``.
+
+Eviction
+--------
+The eviction consumes old generations. Given an ``lruvec``, it
+increments ``min_seq`` when ``lrugen->lists[]`` indexed by
+``min_seq%MAX_NR_GENS`` becomes empty. To select a type and a tier to
+evict from, it first compares ``min_seq[]`` to select the older type.
+If both types are equally old, it selects the one whose first tier has
+a lower refault percentage. The first tier contains single-use
+unmapped clean pages, which are the best bet. The eviction sorts a
+page according to its gen counter if the aging has found this page
+accessed through page tables and updated its gen counter. It also
+moves a page to the next generation, i.e., ``min_seq+1``, if this page
+was accessed multiple times through file descriptors and the feedback
+loop has detected outlying refaults from the tier this page is in. To
+do this, the feedback loop uses the first tier as the baseline, for
+the reason stated earlier.
+
+Summary
+-------
+The multi-gen LRU can be disassembled into the following parts:
+
+* Generations
+* Page table walks
+* Rmap walks
+* Bloom filters
+* PID controller
+
+The aging and the eviction form a producer-consumer model;
+specifically, the latter drives the former by the sliding window over
+generations. Within the aging, rmap walks drive page table walks by
+inserting hot densely populated page tables to the Bloom filters.
+Within the eviction, the PID controller uses refaults as the feedback
+to select types to evict and tiers to protect.

  * Copyright IBM Corp. 2017, 2020
  * Author(s): Harald Freudenberger
- *
- * The s390_arch_random_generate() function may be called from random.c
- * in interrupt context. So this implementation does the best to be very
- * fast. There is a buffer of random data which is asynchronously checked
- * and filled by a workqueue thread.
- * If there are enough bytes in the buffer the s390_arch_random_generate()
- * just delivers these bytes. Otherwise false is returned until the
- * worker thread refills the buffer.
- * The worker fills the rng buffer by pulling fresh entropy from the
- * high quality (but slow) true hardware random generator. This entropy
- * is then spread over the buffer with an pseudo random generator PRNG.
- * As the arch_get_random_seed_long() fetches 8 bytes and the calling
- * function add_interrupt_randomness() counts this as 1 bit entropy the
- * distribution needs to make sure there is in fact 1 bit entropy contained
- * in 8 bytes of the buffer. The current values pull 32 byte entropy
- * and scatter this into a 2048 byte buffer. So 8 byte in the buffer
- * will contain 1 bit of entropy.
- * The worker thread is rescheduled based on the charge level of the
- * buffer but at least with 500 ms delay to avoid too much CPU consumption.
- * So the max. amount of rng data delivered via arch_get_random_seed is
- * limited to 4k bytes per second.

- * Here follows the implementation of s390_arch_get_random_long().
- *
- * The random longs to be pulled by arch_get_random_long() are
- * prepared in an 4K buffer which is filled from the NIST 800-90
- * compliant s390 drbg. By default the random long buffer is refilled
- * 256 times before the drbg itself needs a reseed. The reseed of the
- * drbg is done with 32 bytes fetched from the high quality (but slow)
- * trng which is assumed to deliver 100% entropy. So the 32 * 8 = 256
- * bits of entropy are spread over 256 * 4KB = 1MB serving 131072
- * arch_get_random_long() invocations before reseeded.
- *
- * How often the 4K random long buffer is refilled with the drbg
- * before the drbg is reseeded can be adjusted. There is a module
- * parameter 's390_arch_rnd_long_drbg_reseed' accessible via
- *   /sys/module/arch_random/parameters/rndlong_drbg_reseed
- * or as kernel command line parameter
- *   arch_random.rndlong_drbg_reseed=<value>
- * This parameter tells how often the drbg fills the 4K buffer before
- * it is re-seeded by fresh entropy from the trng.
- * A value of 16 results in reseeding the drbg at every 16 * 4 KB = 64
- * KB with 32 bytes of fresh entropy pulled from the trng. So a value
- * of 16 would result in 256 bits entropy per 64 KB.
- * A value of 256 results in 1MB of drbg output before a reseed of the
- * drbg is done. So this would spread the 256 bits of entropy among 1MB.
- * Setting this parameter to 0 forces the reseed to take place every
- * time the 4K buffer is depleted, so the entropy rises to 256 bits
- * entropy per 4K or 0.5 bit entropy per arch_get_random_long().  With
- * setting this parameter to negative values all this effort is
- * disabled, arch_get_random long() returns false and thus indicating
- * that the arch_get_random_long() feature is disabled at all.

+
+	  The EFI runtime services are disabled by default when PREEMPT_RT is

+	  might take too much time to complete, causing large latencies which is
+	  an issue for Real-Time kernels.
+

+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

+ * This process, AKA second chance, requires a minimum of two generations,

+ * LRU, e.g., /proc/vmstat, these two generations are considered active; the

+ *
+ *  rq1->lock
+ *    rq2->lock  where: rq1 < rq2
+ *
+ * Regular state:
+ *
+ * Normal scheduling state is serialized by rq->lock. __schedule() takes the
+ * local CPU's rq->lock, it optionally removes the task from the runqueue and
+ * always looks at the local rq data structures to find the most eligible task
+ * to run next.
+ *
+ * Task enqueue is also under rq->lock, possibly taken from another CPU.
+ * Wakeups from another LLC domain might use an IPI to transfer the enqueue to
+ * the local CPU to avoid bouncing the runqueue state around [ see
+ * ttwu_queue_wakelist() ]
+ *
+ * Task wakeup, specifically wakeups that involve migration, are horribly
+ * complicated to avoid having to take two rq->locks.
+ *
+ * Special state:
+ *
+ * System-calls and anything external will use task_rq_lock() which acquires
+ * both p->pi_lock and rq->lock. As a consequence the state they change is
+ * stable while holding either lock:
+ *
+ *  - sched_setaffinity()/
+ *    set_cpus_allowed_ptr():	p->cpus_ptr, p->nr_cpus_allowed
+ *  - set_user_nice():		p->se.load, p->*prio
+ *  - __sched_setscheduler():	p->sched_class, p->policy, p->*prio,
+ *				p->se.load, p->rt_priority,
+ *				p->dl.dl_{runtime, deadline, period, flags, bw, density}
+ *  - sched_setnuma():		p->numa_preferred_nid
+ *  - sched_move_task()/
+ *    cpu_cgroup_fork():	p->sched_task_group
+ *  - uclamp_update_active()	p->uclamp*
+ *
+ * p->state <- TASK_*:
+ *
+ *   is changed locklessly using set_current_state(), __set_current_state() or
+ *   set_special_state(), see their respective comments, or by
+ *   try_to_wake_up(). This latter uses p->pi_lock to serialize against
+ *   concurrent self.
+ *
+ * p->on_rq <- { 0, 1 = TASK_ON_RQ_QUEUED, 2 = TASK_ON_RQ_MIGRATING }:
+ *
+ *   is set by activate_task() and cleared by deactivate_task(), under
+ *   rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is runnable, the special
+ *   ON_RQ_MIGRATING state is used for migration without holding both
+ *   rq->locks. It indicates task_cpu() is not stable, see task_rq_lock().
+ *
+ * p->on_cpu <- { 0, 1 }:
+ *
+ *   is set by prepare_task() and cleared by finish_task() such that it will be
+ *   set before p is scheduled-in and cleared after p is scheduled-out, both
+ *   under rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is running on its CPU.
+ *
+ *   [ The astute reader will observe that it is possible for two tasks on one
+ *     CPU to have ->on_cpu = 1 at the same time. ]
+ *
+ * task_cpu(p): is changed by set_task_cpu(), the rules are:
+ *
+ *  - Don't call set_task_cpu() on a blocked task:
+ *
+ *    We don't care what CPU we're not running on, this simplifies hotplug,
+ *    the CPU assignment of blocked tasks isn't required to be valid.
+ *
+ *  - for try_to_wake_up(), called under p->pi_lock:
+ *
+ *    This allows try_to_wake_up() to only take one rq->lock, see its comment.
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under rq->lock:
+ *    [ see task_on_rq_migrating() in task_rq_lock() ]
+ *
+ *    o move_queued_task()
+ *    o detach_task()
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under double_rq_lock():

+ * Notes on Program-Order guarantees on SMP systems.
+ *
+ *  MIGRATION
+ *
+ * The basic program-order guarantee on SMP systems is that when a task [t]
+ * migrates, all its activity on its old CPU [c0] happens-before any subsequent
+ * execution on its new CPU [c1].
+ *
+ * For migration (of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
+ *
+ *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
+ *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
+ *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
+ *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
+ *
+ * Transitivity guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
+ * Note: we only require RCpc transitivity.
+ * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   sched-in Y
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(0)->lock // orders against CPU0
+ *                                   dequeue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *                                   enqueue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *                   LOCK rq(1)->lock // orders against CPU2
+ *                   sched-out Z
+ *                   sched-in X
+ *                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ *  BLOCKING -- aka. SLEEP + WAKEUP
+ *
+ * For blocking we (obviously) need to provide the same guarantee as for
+ * migration. However the means are completely different as there is no lock
+ * chain to provide order. Instead we do:
+ *
+ *   1) smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0)   -- finish_task()
+ *   2) smp_cond_load_acquire(!X->on_cpu) -- try_to_wake_up()
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0 (schedule)  CPU1 (try_to_wake_up) CPU2 (schedule)
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock LOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   dequeue X
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0);
+ *
+ *                    smp_cond_load_acquire(&X->on_cpu, !VAL);
+ *                    X->state = WAKING
+ *                    set_task_cpu(X,2)
+ *
+ *                    LOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *                    enqueue X
+ *                    X->state = RUNNING
+ *                    UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                                          LOCK rq(2)->lock // orders against CPU1
+ *                                          sched-out Z
+ *                                          sched-in X
+ *                                          UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                    UNLOCK X->pi_lock

+ * though, if the storage were faster, both could've ran at the same time,
+ * utilising both CPUs.
+ *
+ * This means, that when looking globally, the current IO-wait accounting on
+ * SMP is a lower bound, by reason of under accounting.

+ * Worse, since the numbers are provided per CPU, they are sometimes

+	BBR2 TCP congestion control is a model-based congestion control

+	or cable modem links, and can use DCTCP-L4S-style ECN signals.  It can
+	coexist with flows that use loss-based congestion control, and can
+	operate with shallow buffers, deep buffers, bufferbloat, policers, or

+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control, v2
+ *
+ * BBRv2 is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low
+ * queues, low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model
+ * of the network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as
+ * (if they occur) packet loss and/or DCTCP/L4S-style ECN signals.  Note that
+ * although it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require
+ * either; it can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
+ *
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
+ *
+ * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
+ *
+ *             |
+ *             V
+ *    +---> STARTUP  ----+

+ *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
+ *
+ * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
+ * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
+ * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
+ * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
+ * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
+ * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
+ * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
+ * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
+ * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a minimum value to re-probe
+ * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
+ * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
+ * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
+ *
+ * BBR is described in detail in:
+ *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
+ *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
+ *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
+ *
+ * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
+ *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
+ *
+ * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
+ * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
+ * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.
