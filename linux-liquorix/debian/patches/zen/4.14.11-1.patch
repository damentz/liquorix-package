+BFQ has a non-null overhead, which limits the maximum IOPS that a CPU
+can process for a device scheduled with BFQ. To give an idea of the
+limits on slow or average CPUs, here are, first, the limits of bfq-mq
+and bfq for three different CPUs, on, respectively, an average laptop,
+an old desktop, and a cheap embedded system, in case full hierarchical
+support is enabled (i.e., CONFIG_MQ_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED is set for
+bfq-mq, or CONFIG_BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED is set for bfq), but
+CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is not set (Section 4-2):
+- Intel i7-4850HQ: 400 KIOPS
+- AMD A8-3850: 250 KIOPS
+- ARM CortexTM-A53 Octa-core: 80 KIOPS
+
+As for bfq-sq, it cannot reach the above IOPS, because of the
+inherent, lower parallelism of legacy blk and of the components within
+it (including bfq-sq itself). In particular, results with
+CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP unset are rather fluctuating. The limits
+reported below for the case CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP set will however
+provide a lower bound to the limits of bfq-sq.
+
+Turning back to bfq-mq and bfq, If CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is set (and
+of course full hierarchical support is enabled), then the sustainable
+throughput with bfq-mq and bfq decreases, because all blkio.bfq*

+BFS - The Brain Fuck Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Brain Fuck Scheduler, referred to as BFS from here on, is to
+completely do away with the complex designs of the past for the cpu process
+scheduler and instead implement one that is very simple in basic design.
+The main focus of BFS is to achieve excellent desktop interactivity and
+responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are difficult to
+understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when tuned to
+one workload cause massive detriment to another.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+BFS is best described as a single runqueue, O(n) lookup, earliest effective
+virtual deadline first design, loosely based on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual
+deadline first) and my previous Staircase Deadline scheduler. Each component
+shall be described in order to understand the significance of, and reasoning for
+it. The codebase when the first stable version was released was approximately
+9000 lines less code than the existing mainline linux kernel scheduler (in
+2.6.31). This does not even take into account the removal of documentation and
+the cgroups code that is not used.
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+The single runqueue refers to the queued but not running processes for the
+entire system, regardless of the number of CPUs. The reason for going back to
+a single runqueue design is that once multiple runqueues are introduced,
+per-CPU or otherwise, there will be complex interactions as each runqueue will
+be responsible for the scheduling latency and fairness of the tasks only on its
+own runqueue, and to achieve fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any
+advantage in throughput of having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages.
+This is due to requiring a very complex balancing system to at best achieve some
+semblance of fairness across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency
+for tasks bound to the same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness
+and latency across CPUs, the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes
+for better scalability, is lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+A significant feature of BFS is that all accounting is done purely based on CPU
+used and nowhere is sleep time used in any way to determine entitlement or
+interactivity. Interactivity "estimators" that use some kind of sleep/run
+algorithm are doomed to fail to detect all interactive tasks, and to falsely tag
+tasks that aren't interactive as being so. The reason for this is that it is
+close to impossible to determine that when a task is sleeping, whether it is
+doing it voluntarily, as in a userspace application waiting for input in the
+form of a mouse click or otherwise, or involuntarily, because it is waiting for
+another thread, process, I/O, kernel activity or whatever. Thus, such an
+estimator will introduce corner cases, and more heuristics will be required to
+cope with those corner cases, introducing more corner cases and failed
+interactivity detection and so on. Interactivity in BFS is built into the design
+by virtue of the fact that tasks that are waking up have not used up their quota
+of CPU time, and have earlier effective deadlines, thereby making it very likely
+they will preempt any CPU bound task of equivalent nice level. See below for
+more information on the virtual deadline mechanism. Even if they do not preempt
+a running task, because the rr interval is guaranteed to have a bound upper
+limit on how long a task will wait for, it will be scheduled within a timeframe
+that will not cause visible interface jitter.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Task insertion.
+
+BFS inserts tasks into each relevant queue as an O(1) insertion into a double
+linked list. On insertion, *every* running queue is checked to see if the newly
+queued task can run on any idle queue, or preempt the lowest running task on the
+system. This is how the cross-CPU scheduling of BFS achieves significantly lower
+latency per extra CPU the system has. In this case the lookup is, in the worst
+case scenario, O(n) where n is the number of CPUs on the system.
+
+Data protection.
+
+BFS has one single lock protecting the process local data of every task in the
+global queue. Thus every insertion, removal and modification of task data in the
+global runqueue needs to grab the global lock. However, once a task is taken by
+a CPU, the CPU has its own local data copy of the running process' accounting
+information which only that CPU accesses and modifies (such as during a
+timer tick) thus allowing the accounting data to be updated lockless. Once a
+CPU has taken a task to run, it removes it from the global queue. Thus the
+global queue only ever has, at most,
+
+	(number of tasks requesting cpu time) - (number of logical CPUs) + 1
+
+tasks in the global queue. This value is relevant for the time taken to look up
+tasks during scheduling. This will increase if many tasks with CPU affinity set
+in their policy to limit which CPUs they're allowed to run on if they outnumber
+the number of CPUs. The +1 is because when rescheduling a task, the CPU's
+currently running task is put back on the queue. Lookup will be described after
+the virtual deadline mechanism is explained.
+
+Virtual deadline.
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in BFS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in BFS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in jiffies by this equation:
+
+	jiffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases. Once a task is descheduled, it is put back on the queue, and an
+O(n) lookup of all queued-but-not-running tasks is done to determine which has
+the earliest deadline and that task is chosen to receive CPU next.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (jiffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup.
+
+BFS has 103 priority queues. 100 of these are dedicated to the static priority
+of realtime tasks, and the remaining 3 are, in order of best to worst priority,
+SCHED_ISO (isochronous), SCHED_NORMAL, and SCHED_IDLEPRIO (idle priority
+scheduling). When a task of these priorities is queued, a bitmap of running
+priorities is set showing which of these priorities has tasks waiting for CPU
+time. When a CPU is made to reschedule, the lookup for the next task to get
+CPU time is performed in the following way:
+
+First the bitmap is checked to see what static priority tasks are queued. If
+any realtime priorities are found, the corresponding queue is checked and the
+first task listed there is taken (provided CPU affinity is suitable) and lookup
+is complete. If the priority corresponds to a SCHED_ISO task, they are also
+taken in FIFO order (as they behave like SCHED_RR). If the priority corresponds
+to either SCHED_NORMAL or SCHED_IDLEPRIO, then the lookup becomes O(n). At this
+stage, every task in the runlist that corresponds to that priority is checked
+to see which has the earliest set deadline, and (provided it has suitable CPU
+affinity) it is taken off the runqueue and given the CPU. If a task has an
+expired deadline, it is taken and the rest of the lookup aborted (as they are
+chosen in FIFO order).
+
+Thus, the lookup is O(n) in the worst case only, where n is as described
+earlier, as tasks may be chosen before the whole task list is looked over.
+
+
+Scalability.
+
+The major limitations of BFS will be that of scalability, as the separate
+runqueue designs will have less lock contention as the number of CPUs rises.
+However they do not scale linearly even with separate runqueues as multiple
+runqueues will need to be locked concurrently on such designs to be able to
+achieve fair CPU balancing, to try and achieve some sort of nice-level fairness
+across CPUs, and to achieve low enough latency for tasks on a busy CPU when
+other CPUs would be more suited. BFS has the advantage that it requires no
+balancing algorithm whatsoever, as balancing occurs by proxy simply because
+all CPUs draw off the global runqueue, in priority and deadline order. Despite
+the fact that scalability is _not_ the prime concern of BFS, it both shows very
+good scalability to smaller numbers of CPUs and is likely a more scalable design
+at these numbers of CPUs.
+
+It also has some very low overhead scalability features built into the design
+when it has been deemed their overhead is so marginal that they're worth adding.
+The first is the local copy of the running process' data to the CPU it's running
+on to allow that data to be updated lockless where possible. Then there is
+deference paid to the last CPU a task was running on, by trying that CPU first
+when looking for an idle CPU to use the next time it's scheduled. Finally there
+is the notion of cache locality beyond the last running CPU. The sched_domains
+information is used to determine the relative virtual "cache distance" that
+other CPUs have from the last CPU a task was running on. CPUs with shared
+caches, such as SMT siblings, or multicore CPUs with shared caches, are treated
+as cache local. CPUs without shared caches are treated as not cache local, and
+CPUs on different NUMA nodes are treated as very distant. This "relative cache
+distance" is used by modifying the virtual deadline value when doing lookups.
+Effectively, the deadline is unaltered between "cache local" CPUs, doubled for
+"cache distant" CPUs, and quadrupled for "very distant" CPUs. The reasoning
+behind the doubling of deadlines is as follows. The real cost of migrating a
+task from one CPU to another is entirely dependant on the cache footprint of
+the task, how cache intensive the task is, how long it's been running on that
+CPU to take up the bulk of its cache, how big the CPU cache is, how fast and
+how layered the CPU cache is, how fast a context switch is... and so on. In
+other words, it's close to random in the real world where we do more than just
+one sole workload. The only thing we can be sure of is that it's not free. So
+BFS uses the principle that an idle CPU is a wasted CPU and utilising idle CPUs
+is more important than cache locality, and cache locality only plays a part
+after that. Doubling the effective deadline is based on the premise that the
+"cache local" CPUs will tend to work on the same tasks up to double the number
+of cache local CPUs, and once the workload is beyond that amount, it is likely
+that none of the tasks are cache warm anywhere anyway. The quadrupling for NUMA
+is a value I pulled out of my arse.
+
+When choosing an idle CPU for a waking task, the cache locality is determined
+according to where the task last ran and then idle CPUs are ranked from best
+to worst to choose the most suitable idle CPU based on cache locality, NUMA
+node locality and hyperthread sibling business. They are chosen in the
+following preference (if idle):
+
+* Same core, idle or busy cache, idle threads
+* Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same core, busy threads.
+* Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+This shows the SMT or "hyperthread" awareness in the design as well which will
+choose a real idle core first before a logical SMT sibling which already has
+tasks on the physical CPU.
+
+Early benchmarking of BFS suggested scalability dropped off at the 16 CPU mark.
+However this benchmarking was performed on an earlier design that was far less
+scalable than the current one so it's hard to know how scalable it is in terms
+of both CPUs (due to the global runqueue) and heavily loaded machines (due to
+O(n) lookup) at this stage. Note that in terms of scalability, the number of
+_logical_ CPUs matters, not the number of _physical_ CPUs. Thus, a dual (2x)
+quad core (4X) hyperthreaded (2X) machine is effectively a 16X. Newer benchmark
+results are very promising indeed, without needing to tweak any knobs, features
+or options. Benchmark contributions are most welcome.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for BFS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are precisely 2 tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval
+and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO policies. In addition
+to this, BFS also uses sub-tick accounting. What BFS does _not_ now feature is
+support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither need to know what these
+are, nor should they need to be using them to have good desktop behaviour.
+
+rr_interval
+
+There is only one "scheduler" tunable, the round robin interval. This can be
+accessed in
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6 on a
+uniprocessor machine, and automatically set to a progressively higher value on
+multiprocessor machines. The reasoning behind increasing the value on more CPUs
+is that the effective latency is decreased by virtue of there being more CPUs on
+BFS (for reasons explained above), and increasing the value allows for less
+cache contention and more throughput. Valid values are from 1 to 1000
+Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of decreasing
+throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the cost of
+worsening latencies. The accuracy of the rr interval is limited by HZ resolution
+of the kernel configuration. Thus, the worst case latencies are usually slightly
+higher than this actual value. The default value of 6 is not an arbitrary one.
+It is based on the fact that humans can detect jitter at approximately 7ms, so
+aiming for much lower latencies is pointless under most circumstances. It is
+worth noting this fact when comparing the latency performance of BFS to other
+schedulers. Worst case latencies being higher than 7ms are far worse than
+average latencies not being in the microsecond range.
+
+Isochronous scheduling.
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of _total CPU_ available across the machine, configurable
+as a percentage in the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a
+scheduler tunable):
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of BFS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+Because some applications constantly set their policy as well as their nice
+level, there is potential for them to undo the override specified by the user
+on the command line of setting the policy to SCHED_ISO. To counter this, once
+a task has been set to SCHED_ISO policy, it needs superuser privileges to set
+it back to SCHED_NORMAL. This will ensure the task remains ISO and all child
+processes and threads will also inherit the ISO policy.
+
+Idleprio scheduling.
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start
+a video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this
+policy from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it
+detects a state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to
+suspend to ram and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. As
+per the Isochronous task management, once a task has been scheduled as IDLEPRIO,
+it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without superuser privileges. Tasks can
+be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+	schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting.
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the
+timer tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application
+which uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records
+zero CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible
+security implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task
+really does use. BFS tries to use the sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock,
+where possible, to determine real CPU usage. This is not entirely reliable, but
+is far more likely to produce accurate CPU usage data than the existing designs
+and will not show tasks as consuming no CPU usage when they actually are. Thus,
+the amount of CPU reported as being used by BFS will more accurately represent
+how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for example by the 'time'
+application), so the reported values may be quite different to other schedulers.
+Values reported as the 'load' are more prone to problems with this design, but
+per process values are closer to real usage. When comparing throughput of BFS
+to other designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms
+of total wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported
+"cpu usage".

+MuQSS - The Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+MuQSS is a per-cpu runqueue variant of the original BFS scheduler with
+one 8 level skiplist per runqueue, and fine grained locking for much more
+scalability.
+
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler, referred to as MuQSS from
+here on (pronounced mux) is to completely do away with the complex designs of
+the past for the cpu process scheduler and instead implement one that is very
+simple in basic design. The main focus of MuQSS is to achieve excellent desktop
+interactivity and responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are
+difficult to understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when
+tuned to one workload cause massive detriment to another, while still being
+scalable to many CPUs and processes.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+MuQSS is best described as per-cpu multiple runqueue, O(log n) insertion, O(1)
+lookup, earliest effective virtual deadline first tickless design, loosely based
+on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual deadline first) and my previous Staircase
+Deadline scheduler, and evolved from the single runqueue O(n) BFS scheduler.
+Each component shall be described in order to understand the significance of,
+and reasoning for it.
+
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+In BFS, the use of a single runqueue across all CPUs meant that each CPU would
+need to scan the entire runqueue looking for the process with the earliest
+deadline and schedule that next, regardless of which CPU it originally came
+from. This made BFS deterministic with respect to latency and provided
+guaranteed latencies dependent on number of processes and CPUs. The single
+runqueue, however, meant that all CPUs would compete for the single lock
+protecting it, which would lead to increasing lock contention as the number of
+CPUs rose and appeared to limit scalability of common workloads beyond 16
+logical CPUs. Additionally, the O(n) lookup of the runqueue list obviously
+increased overhead proportionate to the number of queued proecesses and led to
+cache thrashing while iterating over the linked list.
+
+MuQSS is an evolution of BFS, designed to maintain the same scheduling
+decision mechanism and be virtually deterministic without relying on the
+constrained design of the single runqueue by splitting out the single runqueue
+to be per-CPU and use skiplists instead of linked lists.
+
+The original reason for going back to a single runqueue design for BFS was that
+once multiple runqueues are introduced, per-CPU or otherwise, there will be
+complex interactions as each runqueue will be responsible for the scheduling
+latency and fairness of the tasks only on its own runqueue, and to achieve
+fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any advantage in throughput of
+having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages. This is due to requiring a
+very complex balancing system to at best achieve some semblance of fairness
+across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency for tasks bound to the
+same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness and latency across CPUs,
+the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes for better scalability, is
+lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+MuQSS works around the problems inherent in multiple runqueue designs by
+making its skip lists priority ordered and through novel use of lockless
+examination of each other runqueue it can decide if it should take the earliest
+deadline task from another runqueue for latency reasons, or for CPU balancing
+reasons. It still does not have a balancing system, choosing to allow the
+next task scheduling decision and task wakeup CPU choice to allow balancing to
+happen by virtue of its choices.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Custom skip list implementation:
+
+To avoid the overhead of building up and tearing down skip list structures,
+the variant used by MuQSS has a number of optimisations making it specific for
+its use case in the scheduler. It uses static arrays of 8 'levels' instead of
+building up and tearing down structures dynamically. This makes each runqueue
+only scale O(log N) up to 64k tasks. However as there is one runqueue per CPU
+it means that it scales O(log N) up to 64k x number of logical CPUs which is
+far beyond the realistic task limits each CPU could handle. By being 8 levels
+it also makes the array exactly one cacheline in size. Additionally, each
+skip list node is bidirectional making insertion and removal amortised O(1),
+being O(k) where k is 1-8. Uniquely, we are only ever interested in the very
+first entry in each list at all times with MuQSS, so there is never a need to
+do a search and thus look up is always O(1). In interactive mode, the queues
+will be searched beyond their first entry if the first task is not suitable
+for affinity or SMT nice reasons.
+
+Task insertion:
+
+MuQSS inserts tasks into a per CPU runqueue as an O(log N) insertion into
+a custom skip list as described above (based on the original design by William
+Pugh). Insertion is ordered in such a way that there is never a need to do a
+search by ordering tasks according to static priority primarily, and then
+virtual deadline at the time of insertion.
+
+Niffies:
+
+Niffies are a monotonic forward moving timer not unlike the "jiffies" but are
+of nanosecond resolution. Niffies are calculated per-runqueue from the high
+resolution TSC timers, and in order to maintain fairness are synchronised
+between CPUs whenever both runqueues are locked concurrently.
+
+Virtual deadline:
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in MuQSS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in MuQSS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in niffies by this equation:
+
+	niffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (niffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup:
+
+As tasks are already pre-ordered according to anticipated scheduling order in
+the skip lists, lookup for the next suitable task per-runqueue is always a
+matter of simply selecting the first task in the 0th level skip list entry.
+In order to maintain optimal latency and fairness across CPUs, MuQSS does a
+novel examination of every other runqueue in cache locality order, choosing the
+best task across all runqueues. This provides near-determinism of how long any
+task across the entire system may wait before receiving CPU time. The other
+runqueues are first examine lockless and then trylocked to minimise the
+potential lock contention if they are likely to have a suitable better task.
+Each other runqueue lock is only held for as long as it takes to examine the
+entry for suitability. In "interactive" mode, the default setting, MuQSS will
+look for the best deadline task across all CPUs, while in !interactive mode,
+it will only select a better deadline task from another CPU if it is more
+heavily laden than the current one.
+
+Lookup is therefore O(k) where k is number of CPUs.
+
+
+Latency.
+
+Through the use of virtual deadlines to govern the scheduling order of normal
+tasks, queue-to-activation latency per runqueue is guaranteed to be bound by
+the rr_interval tunable which is set to 6ms by default. This means that the
+longest a CPU bound task will wait for more CPU is proportional to the number
+of running tasks and in the common case of 0-2 running tasks per CPU, will be
+under the 7ms threshold for human perception of jitter. Additionally, as newly
+woken tasks will have an early deadline from their previous runtime, the very
+tasks that are usually latency sensitive will have the shortest interval for
+activation, usually preempting any existing CPU bound tasks.
+
+Tickless expiry:
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it is not tied to the resolution of the chosen tick
+rate in Hz, instead depending entirely on the high resolution timers where
+possible for sub-millisecond accuracy on timeouts regarless of the underlying
+tick rate. This allows MuQSS to be run with the low overhead of low Hz rates
+such as 100 by default, benefiting from the improved throughput and lower
+power usage it provides. Another advantage of this approach is that in
+combination with the Full No HZ option, which disables ticks on running task
+CPUs instead of just idle CPUs, the tick can be disabled at all times
+regardless of how many tasks are running instead of being limited to just one
+running task. Note that this option is NOT recommended for regular desktop
+users.
+
+
+Scalability and balancing.
+
+Unlike traditional approaches where balancing is a combination of CPU selection
+at task wakeup and intermittent balancing based on a vast array of rules set
+according to architecture, busyness calculations and special case management,
+MuQSS indirectly balances on the fly at task wakeup and next task selection.
+During initialisation, MuQSS creates a cache coherency ordered list of CPUs for
+each logical CPU and uses this to aid task/CPU selection when CPUs are busy.
+Additionally it selects any idle CPUs, if they are available, at any time over
+busy CPUs according to the following preference:
+
+ * Same thread, idle or busy cache, idle or busy threads
+ * Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+Mux is therefore SMT, MC and Numa aware without the need for extra
+intermittent balancing to maintain CPUs busy and make the most of cache
+coherency.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for MuQSS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are 3 optional tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval,
+interactive, and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO
+policies. In addition to this, MuQSS also uses sub-tick accounting. What MuQSS
+does _not_ now feature is support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither
+need to know what these are, nor should they need to be using them to have good
+desktop behaviour. However since some applications refuse to work without
+cgroups, one can enable them with MuQSS as a stub and the filesystem will be
+created which will allow the applications to work.
+
+rr_interval:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6. Valid values
+are from 1 to 1000 Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of
+decreasing throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the
+cost of worsening latencies. It is based on the fact that humans can detect
+jitter at approximately 7ms, so aiming for much lower latencies is pointless
+under most circumstances. It is worth noting this fact when comparing the
+latency performance of MuQSS to other schedulers. Worst case latencies being
+higher than 7ms are far worse than average latencies not being in the
+microsecond range.
+
+interactive:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/interactive
+
+The value is a simple boolean of 1 for on and 0 for off and is set to on by
+default. Disabling this will disable the near-determinism of MuQSS when
+selecting the next task by not examining all CPUs for the earliest deadline
+task, or which CPU to wake to, instead prioritising CPU balancing for improved
+throughput. Latency will still be bound by rr_interval, but on a per-CPU basis
+instead of across the whole system.
+
+Isochronous scheduling:
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of CPU available per CPU, configurable as a percentage in
+the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a scheduler tunable):
+
+iso_cpu:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+
+
+Idleprio scheduling:
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start a
+video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this policy
+from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it detects a
+state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to suspend to ram
+and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. Once a task has
+been scheduled as IDLEPRIO, it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without
+superuser privileges since it is effectively a lower scheduling policy. Tasks
+can be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting:
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the timer
+tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application which
+uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records zero
+CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible security
+implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task really does
+use. Mux uses sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock to determine real CPU
+usage. Thus, the amount of CPU reported as being used by MuQSS will more
+accurately represent how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for
+example by the 'time' application), so the reported values may be quite
+different to other schedulers. When comparing throughput of MuQSS to other
+designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms of total
+wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported "cpu usage".
+
+Symmetric MultiThreading (SMT) aware nice:
+
+SMT, a.k.a. hyperthreading, is a very common feature on modern CPUs. While the
+logical CPU count rises by adding thread units to each CPU core, allowing more
+than one task to be run simultaneously on the same core, the disadvantage of it
+is that the CPU power is shared between the tasks, not summating to the power
+of two CPUs. The practical upshot of this is that two tasks running on
+separate threads of the same core run significantly slower than if they had one
+core each to run on. While smart CPU selection allows each task to have a core
+to itself whenever available (as is done on MuQSS), it cannot offset the
+slowdown that occurs when the cores are all loaded and only a thread is left.
+Most of the time this is harmless as the CPU is effectively overloaded at this
+point and the extra thread is of benefit. However when running a niced task in
+the presence of an un-niced task (say nice 19 v nice 0), the nice task gets
+precisely the same amount of CPU power as the unniced one. MuQSS has an
+optional configuration feature known as SMT-NICE which selectively idles the
+secondary niced thread for a period proportional to the nice difference,
+allowing CPU distribution according to nice level to be maintained, at the
+expense of a small amount of extra overhead. If this is configured in on a
+machine without SMT threads, the overhead is minimal.

+Description
+-----------
+
+ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS
+(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
+hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.
+
+This driver exposes some features of the SMAPI BIOS through a sysfs
+interface. It is suitable for newer models, on which SMAPI is invoked
+through IO port writes. Older models use a different SMAPI interface;
+for those, try the "thinkpad" module from the "tpctl" package.
+
+WARNING:
+This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
+It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
+(especially on models it wasn't tested on).
+
+
+Module parameters
+-----------------
+
+thinkpad_ec module:
+  force_io=1 lets thinkpad_ec load on some recent ThinkPad models

+# echo 70 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/*_charge_thresh
+
+    (This is useful since Li-Ion batteries wear out much faster at very
+     high or low charge levels. The driver will also keeps the thresholds
+     across suspend-to-disk with AC disconnected; this isn't done
+     automatically by the hardware.)
+
+Inhibiting battery charging for 17 minutes (overrides thresholds):
+
+# echo 17 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+# echo 0  > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes  # stop
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+
+    (This can be used to control which battery is charged when using an
+     Ultrabay battery.)
+
+Forcing battery discharging even if AC power available:
+
+# echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # start discharge
+# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # stop discharge
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge
+
+    (When AC is connected, forced discharging will automatically stop
+     when battery is fully depleted -- this is useful for calibration.
+     Also, this attribute can be used to control which battery is discharged
+     when both a system battery and an Ultrabay battery are connected.)

+
+The BAT0/group{0,1,2,3}_voltage attribute refers to the separate cell groups
+in each battery. For example, on the ThinkPad 600, X3x, T4x and R5x models,
+the battery contains 3 cell groups in series, where each group consisting of 2
+or 3 cells  connected in parallel. The voltage of each group is given by these
+attributes, and their sum (roughly) equals the "voltage" attribute.
+(The effective performance of the battery is determined by the weakest group,
+i.e., the one those voltage changes most rapidly during dis/charging.)
+
+The "BAT0/dump" attribute gives a a hex dump of the raw status data, which
+contains additional data now in the above (if you can figure it out). Some
+unused values are autodetected and replaced by "--":
+
+In all of the above, replace BAT0 with BAT1 to address the 2nd battery (e.g.
+in the UltraBay).
+
+
+Raw SMAPI calls:
+
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+This performs raw SMAPI calls. It uses a bad interface that cannot handle
+multiple simultaneous access. Don't touch it, it's for development only.
+If you did touch it, you would so something like
+# echo '211a 100 0 0' > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+and notice that in the output "211a 34b b2 0 0 0 'OK'", the "4b" in the 2nd
+value, converted to decimal is 75: the current charge stop threshold.

+* Z60t, Z61m
+
+Does not work on:
+* X230 and newer
+* T430 and newer
+* Any ThinkPad Edge
+* Any ThinkPad Yoga
+* Any ThinkPad L series
+* Any ThinkPad P series
+
+Not all functions are available on all models; for detailed status, see:
+  http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi
+
+Please report success/failure by e-mail or on the Wiki.
+If you get a "not implemented" or "not supported" message, your laptop
+probably just can't do that (at least not via the SMAPI BIOS).
+For negative reports, follow the bug reporting guidelines below.
+If you send me the necessary technical data (i.e., SMAPI function
+interfaces), I will support additional models.
+
+
+Additional HDAPS features
+-------------------------
+
+The modified hdaps driver has several improvements on the one in mainline
+(beyond resolving the conflict with thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi):
+
+- Fixes reliability and improves support for recent ThinkPad models
+  (especially *60 and newer). Unlike the mainline driver, the modified hdaps
+  correctly follows the Embedded Controller communication protocol.
+
+- Extends the "invert" parameter to cover all possible axis orientations.
+  The possible values are as follows.
+  Let X,Y denote the hardware readouts.
+  Let R denote the laptop's roll (tilt left/right).
+  Let P denote the laptop's pitch (tilt forward/backward).
+    invert=0:   R= X  P= Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=1:   R=-X  P=-Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=2:   R=-X  P= Y   (new)
+    invert=3:   R= X  P=-Y   (new)
+    invert=4:   R= Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=5:   R=-Y  P=-X   (new)
+    invert=6:   R=-Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=7:   R= Y  P=-X   (new)
+  It's probably easiest to just try all 8 possibilities and see which yields
+  correct results (e.g., in the hdaps-gl visualisation).
+
+- Adds a whitelist which automatically sets the correct axis orientation for
+  some models. If the value for your model is wrong or missing, you can override
+  it using the "invert" parameter. Please also update the tables at
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi and
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/List_of_DMI_IDs
+  and submit a patch for the whitelist in hdaps.c.
+
+- Provides new attributes:
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/sampling_rate:
+    This determines the frequency at which the host queries the embedded
+    controller for accelerometer data (and informs the hdaps input devices).
+    Default=50.
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/oversampling_ratio:
+    When set to X, the embedded controller is told to do physical accelerometer
+    measurements at a rate that is X times higher than the rate at which
+    the driver reads those measurements (i.e., X*sampling_rate). This
+    makes the readouts from the embedded controller more fresh, and is also
+    useful for the running average filter (see next). Default=5
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/running_avg_filter_order:
+    When set to X, reported readouts will be the average of the last X physical
+    accelerometer measurements. Current firmware allows 1<=X<=8. Setting to a
+    high value decreases readout fluctuations. The averaging is handled by the
+    embedded controller, so no CPU resources are used. Higher values make the
+    readouts smoother, since it averages out both sensor noise (good) and abrupt
+    changes (bad). Default=2.
+
+- Provides a second input device, which publishes the raw accelerometer
+  measurements (without the fuzzing needed for joystick emulation). This input
+  device can be matched by a udev rule such as the following (all on one line):
+    KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{phys}=="hdaps/input1",
+    ATTRS{modalias}=="input:b0019v1014p5054e4801-*",
+    SYMLINK+="input/hdaps/accelerometer-event
+
+A new version of the hdapsd userspace daemon, which uses the input device
+interface instead of polling sysfs, is available seprately. Using this reduces
+the total interrupts per second generated by hdaps+hdapsd (on tickless kernels)
+to 50, down from a value that fluctuates between 50 and 100. Set the
+sampling_rate sysfs attribute to a lower value to further reduce interrupts,
+at the expense of response latency.
+
+Licensing note: all my changes to the HDAPS driver are licensed under the
+GPL version 2 or, at your option and to the extent allowed by derivation from
+prior works, any later version. My version of hdaps is derived work from the
+mainline version, which at the time of writing is available only under
+GPL version 2.
+
+Bug reporting
+-------------
+
+Mail <multinymous@gmail.com>. Please include:
+* Details about your model,
+* Relevant "dmesg" output. Make sure thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi are loaded with
+  the "debug=1" parameter (e.g., use "make load HDAPS=1 DEBUG=1").
+* Output of "dmidecode | grep -C5 Product"
+* Does the failed functionality works under Windows?
+
+
+More about SMAPI
+----------------
+
+For hints about what may be possible via the SMAPI BIOS and how, see:
+
+* IBM Technical Reference Manual for the ThinkPad 770
+  (http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=PFAN-3TUQQD)
+* Exported symbols in PWRMGRIF.DLL or TPPWRW32.DLL (e.g., use "objdump -x").
+* drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c in the Linux kernel tree.*
+* The "thinkpad" SMAPI module (http://tpctl.sourceforge.net).
+* The SMAPI_* constants in tp_smapi.c.
+
+Note that in the above Technical Reference and in the "thinkpad" module,
+SMAPI is invoked through a function call to some physical address. However,
+the interface used by tp_smapi and the above mwave drive, and apparently
+required by newer ThinkPad, is different: you set the parameters up in the
+CPU's registers and write to ports 0xB2 (the APM control port) and 0x4F; this
+triggers an SMI (System Management Interrupt), causing the CPU to enter
+SMM (System Management Mode) and run the BIOS firmware; the results are
+returned in the CPU's registers. It is not clear what is the relation between
+the two variants of SMAPI, though the assignment of error codes seems to be
+similar.
+
+In addition, the embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard
+interface at IO ports 0x1600-0x161F (mapped to LCP channel 3 of the H8S chip).
+The interface provides various system management services (currently known:
+battery information and accelerometer readouts). For more information see the
+thinkpad_ec module and the H8S hardware documentation:
+http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/mpumcu/rej09b0300_2140bhm.pdf

+	 * from destroying both the original blkg and all objects
+	 * directly or indirectly referred by the copy of the
+	 * blkg.
+	 *
+	 * On the bright side, destroy operations on a blkg invoke, as
+	 * a first step, hooks of the scheduler associated with the
+	 * blkg. And these hooks are executed with bfqd->lock held for

+	 * that all the pointers it contains are consistent, while we
+	 * are holding bfqd->lock. A blkg_lookup performed with
+	 * bfqd->lock held then returns a fully consistent blkg, which
+	 * remains consistent until this lock is held.
+	 *
+	 * Thanks to the last fact, and to the fact that: (1) bfqg has
+	 * been obtained through a blkg_lookup in the above
+	 * assignment, and (2) bfqd->lock is being held, here we can
+	 * safely use the policy data for the involved blkg (i.e., the

+	 * and then we can safely use any field of blkg. After we
+	 * release bfqd->lock, even just getting blkg through this
+	 * bfqg may cause dangling references to be traversed, as
+	 * bfqg->pd may not exist any more.
+	 *
+	 * In view of the above facts, here we cache, in the bfqg, any
+	 * blkg data we may need for this bic, and for its associated
+	 * bfq_queue. As of now, we need to cache only the path of the
+	 * blkg, which is used in the bfq_log_* functions.
+	 *
+	 * Finally, note that bfqg itself needs to be protected from
+	 * destruction on the blkg_free of the original blkg (which

+ *
+ * Licensed under the GPL-2 as detailed in the accompanying COPYING.BFQ
+ * file.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial, more
+ * theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader can find
+ * in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as well as
+ * formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the properties.
+ * With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these papers, this
+ * implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the one that
+ * guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications, and a
+ * hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * In particular, R is the peak rate of the reference device (see
+ * below), and T is a reference time: given the systems that are
+ * likely to be installed on the reference device according to its
+ * speed class, T is about the maximum time needed, under BFQ and
+ * while reading two files in parallel, to load typical large
+ * applications on these systems (see the comments on
+ * max_service_from_wr below, for more details on how T is obtained).
+ * In practice, the slower/faster the device at hand is, the more/less
+ * it takes to load applications with respect to the reference device.
+ * Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants weight raising to
+ * interactive applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses four different reference pairs (R, T), depending on:
+ * . whether the device is rotational or non-rotational;
+ * . whether the device is slow, such as old or portable HDDs, as well as
+ *   SD cards, or fast, such as newer HDDs and SSDs.
+ *
+ * The device's speed class is dynamically (re)detected in
+ * bfq_update_peak_rate() every time the estimated peak rate is updated.
+ *
+ * In the following definitions, R_slow[0]/R_fast[0] and
+ * T_slow[0]/T_fast[0] are the reference values for a slow/fast
+ * rotational device, whereas R_slow[1]/R_fast[1] and
+ * T_slow[1]/T_fast[1] are the reference values for a slow/fast
+ * non-rotational device. Finally, device_speed_thresh are the
+ * thresholds used to switch between speed classes. The reference
+ * rates are not the actual peak rates of the devices used as a
+ * reference, but slightly lower values. The reason for using these
+ * slightly lower values is that the peak-rate estimator tends to
+ * yield slightly lower values than the actual peak rate (it can yield
+ * the actual peak rate only if there is only one process doing I/O,
+ * and the process does sequential I/O).

+ * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
+ * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
+ * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
+ * while being weight-raised, these applications
+ * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
+ * low latency;
+ * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
+ * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
+ * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
+ *
+ * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
+ * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
+ * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
+ * interactive tasks is computed.
+ *
+ * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
+ * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
+ * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
+ * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
+ * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
+ * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
+ * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
+ * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
+ * sectors transferred.
+ *
+ * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
+ * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
+ * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
+ * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
+ * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
+ * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
+ * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
+ * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
+ * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
+ * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
+ * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
+ * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
+ * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
+ *
+ * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
+ * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
+ * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
+ * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
+ *
+ * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
+ * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems
+ * described at the beginning of these comments.

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created
+ * shortly after each other, then the processes associated with these
+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q
+ *          after this step).

+/*
+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * previous one has been completed). This makes it hard to evaluate
+ * the real rate at which the I/O requests of each bfq_queue are
+ * served.  In fact, for an I/O scheduler like BFQ, serving a
+ * bfq_queue means just dispatching its requests during its service
+ * slot (i.e., until the budget of the queue is exhausted, or the
+ * queue remains idle, or, finally, a timeout fires). But, during the
+ * service slot of a bfq_queue, around 100 ms at most, the device may
+ * be even still processing requests of bfq_queues served in previous
+ * service slots. On the opposite end, the requests of the in-service
+ * bfq_queue may be completed after the service slot of the queue
+ * finishes.
+ *
+ * Anyway, unless more sophisticated solutions are used
+ * (where possible), the sum of the sizes of the requests dispatched
+ * during the service slot of a bfq_queue is probably the only
+ * approximation available for the service received by the bfq_queue
+ * during its service slot. And this sum is the quantity used in this
+ * function to evaluate the I/O speed of a process.

+ * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two

+ * bandwidth higher than the approximate bandwidth required to playback or
+ * record a compressed high-definition video.
+ * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may
+ * happen to meet, occasionally or systematically, both the above
+ * bandwidth and isochrony requirements. This may happen at least in
+ * the following circumstances. First, if the CPU load is high. The
+ * application may stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy
+ * serving other processes, then restart, then stop again for a while,
+ * and so on. The other circumstances are related to the storage
+ * device: the storage device is highly loaded or reaches a low-enough
+ * throughput with the I/O of the application (e.g., because the I/O
+ * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
+ * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
+ * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
+ * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
+ * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: the return value of this function is forced to
+ * be higher than the maximum between the following two quantities.
+ *
+ * (a) Current time plus: (1) the maximum time for which the arrival
+ *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
+ *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
+ *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
+ *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
+ *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
+ *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
+ *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
+ *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
+ *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
+ *     batch of its requests has been completed.
+ *
+ * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
+ *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
+ *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
+ *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
+ *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
+ *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
+ *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
+ *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
+ *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
+ *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
+ *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
+ *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
+ *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
+ *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
+ *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
+ *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
+ *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
+ *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
+ *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
+ *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
+ *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
+ *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
+ *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
+ *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
+ *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
+ *
+ * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
+ * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
+ * application, if the reference quantity was just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
+ *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
+ *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
+ *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
+ *    is rather lower than the exact value.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
+ * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
+ * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite
+ * precise also in embedded systems and KVM/QEMU virtual machines.

+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+	 * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible
+	 * to let requests be served in the desired order until all
+	 * the requests already queued in the device have been served.

+ *
+ * Licensed under the GPL-2 as detailed in the accompanying COPYING.BFQ
+ * file.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial, more
+ * theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader can find
+ * in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as well as
+ * formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the properties.
+ * With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these papers, this
+ * implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the one that
+ * guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications, and a
+ * hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * In particular, R is the peak rate of the reference device (see
+ * below), and T is a reference time: given the systems that are
+ * likely to be installed on the reference device according to its
+ * speed class, T is about the maximum time needed, under BFQ and
+ * while reading two files in parallel, to load typical large
+ * applications on these systems (see the comments on
+ * max_service_from_wr below, for more details on how T is obtained).
+ * In practice, the slower/faster the device at hand is, the more/less
+ * it takes to load applications with respect to the reference device.
+ * Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants weight raising to
+ * interactive applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses four different reference pairs (R, T), depending on:
+ * . whether the device is rotational or non-rotational;
+ * . whether the device is slow, such as old or portable HDDs, as well as
+ *   SD cards, or fast, such as newer HDDs and SSDs.
+ *
+ * The device's speed class is dynamically (re)detected in

+ * rotational device, whereas R_slow[1]/R_fast[1] and
+ * T_slow[1]/T_fast[1] are the reference values for a slow/fast
+ * non-rotational device. Finally, device_speed_thresh are the
+ * thresholds used to switch between speed classes. The reference
+ * rates are not the actual peak rates of the devices used as a
+ * reference, but slightly lower values. The reason for using these
+ * slightly lower values is that the peak-rate estimator tends to
+ * yield slightly lower values than the actual peak rate (it can yield
+ * the actual peak rate only if there is only one process doing I/O,
+ * and the process does sequential I/O).

+ * BFQ uses the above-detailed, time-based weight-raising mechanism to
+ * privilege interactive tasks. This mechanism is vulnerable to the
+ * following false positives: I/O-bound applications that will go on
+ * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
+ * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
+ * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
+ * while being weight-raised, these applications
+ * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
+ * low latency;
+ * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
+ * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
+ * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
+ *
+ * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
+ * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
+ * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
+ * interactive tasks is computed.
+ *
+ * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
+ * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
+ * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
+ * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
+ * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
+ * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
+ * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
+ * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
+ * sectors transfered.
+ *
+ * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
+ * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
+ * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
+ * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
+ * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
+ * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
+ * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
+ * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
+ * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
+ * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
+ * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
+ * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
+ * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
+ *
+ * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
+ * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
+ * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
+ * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
+ *
+ * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
+ * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems
+ * described at the beginning of these comments.

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created
+ * shortly after each other, then the processes associated with these
+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q
+ *          after this step).

+/*
+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is

+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may

+ * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
+ * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
+ * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
+ * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
+ * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of

+ *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
+ *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
+ *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
+ *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
+ *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
+ *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
+ *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
+ *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
+ *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
+ *     batch of its requests has been completed.
+ *
+ * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
+ *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
+ *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
+ *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
+ *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
+ *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
+ *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
+ *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
+ *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
+ *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
+ *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
+ *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
+ *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
+ *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
+ *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
+ *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
+ *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
+ *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
+ *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
+ *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
+ *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
+ *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
+ *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
+ *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
+ *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
+ *
+ * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
+ * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
+ * application, if the reference quantity was just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
+ *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
+ *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
+ *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
+ *    is rather lower than the exact value.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
+ * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
+ * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite
+ * precise also in embedded systems and KVM/QEMU virtual machines.

+	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+	 * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+	 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because

+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some

+/*
+ *  tp_smapi.c - ThinkPad SMAPI support
+ *
+ *  This driver exposes some features of the System Management Application
+ *  Program Interface (SMAPI) BIOS found on ThinkPad laptops. It works on
+ *  models in which the SMAPI BIOS runs in SMM and is invoked by writing
+ *  to the APM control port 0xB2.
+ *  It also exposes battery status information, obtained from the ThinkPad
+ *  embedded controller (via the thinkpad_ec module).
+ *  Ancient ThinkPad models use a different interface, supported by the
+ *  "thinkpad" module from "tpctl".
+ *
+ *  Many of the battery status values obtained from the EC simply mirror
+ *  values provided by the battery's Smart Battery System (SBS) interface, so
+ *  their meaning is defined by the Smart Battery Data Specification (see
+ *  http://sbs-forum.org/specs/sbdat110.pdf). References to this SBS spec
+ *  are given in the code where relevant.

+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+                            NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

+exfat-nofuse
+============
+
+Linux non-fuse read/write kernel driver for the exFAT, FAT12, FAT16 and vfat (FAT32) file systems.<br />
+Originally ported from Android kernel v3.0.
+
+Kudos to ksv1986 for the mutex patch!<br />
+Thanks to JackNorris for being awesome and providing the clear_inode() patch.<br />
+<br />
+Big thanks to lqs for completing the driver!<br />
+Big thanks to benpicco for fixing 3.11.y compatibility!
+
+
+Special thanks to github user AndreiLux for spreading the word about the leak!<br />
+
+
+Installing as a stand-alone module:
+====================================
+
+    make
+    sudo make install
+
+To load the driver manually, run this as root:
+
+    modprobe exfat
+
+You may also specify custom toolchains by using CROSS_COMPILE flag, in my case:
+>CROSS_COMPILE=../dorimanx-SG2-I9100-Kernel/android-toolchain/bin/arm-eabi-
+
+Installing as a part of the kernel:
+======================================
+
+Let's take [linux] as the path to your kernel source dir...
+
+	cd [linux]
+	cp -rvf exfat-nofuse [linux]/fs/exfat
+
+edit [linux]/fs/Kconfig
+```
+ menu "DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems"
+
+  source "fs/fat/Kconfig"
+ +source "fs/exfat/Kconfig"
+  source "fs/ntfs/Kconfig"
+  endmenu
+```
+  
+
+edit [linux]/fs/Makefile
+```
+  obj-$(CONFIG_FAT_FS)    += fat/
+ +obj-$(CONFIG_EXFAT_FS)  += exfat/
+  obj-$(CONFIG_BFS_FS)    += bfs/
+```
+
+	cd [linux]
+	make menuconfig
+
+Go to:
+> File systems > DOS/FAT/NT
+>   check exfat as MODULE (M)
+>   (437) Default codepage for exFAT
+>   (utf8) Default iocharset for exFAT
+
+> ESC to main menu
+> Save an Alternate Configuration File
+> ESC ESC
+
+build your kernel
+
+Have fun.
+
+
+Installing as a DKMS module:
+=================================
+
+You can have even more fun with exfat-nofuse by installing it as a DKMS module has the main advantage of being auto-compiled (and thus, possibly surviving) between kernel upgrades.
+
+First, get dkms. On Ubuntu this should be:
+
+	sudo apt install dkms
+
+Then copy the root of this repository to /usr/share:
+
+	sudo cp -R . /usr/src/exfat-1.2.8 (or whatever version number declared on dkms.conf is)
+	sudo dkms add -m exfat -v 1.2.8
+
+Build and load the module:
+
+	sudo dkms build -m exfat -v 1.2.8
+	sudo dkms install -m exfat -v 1.2.8
+
+Now you have a proper dkms module that will work for a long time... hopefully.
+
+
+
+Free Software for the Free Minds!

+ *   2. TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is checked on interrupt and userspace return

+ * tasks queued on it (overloaded) needs to be notified that a CPU has opened
+ * up that may be able to run one of its non-running queued RT tasks.
+ *
+ * All CPUs with overloaded RT tasks need to be notified as there is currently
+ * no way to know which of these CPUs have the highest priority task waiting
+ * to run. Instead of trying to take a spinlock on each of these CPUs,
+ * which has shown to cause large latency when done on machines with many
+ * CPUs, sending an IPI to the CPUs to have them push off the overloaded
+ * RT tasks waiting to run.
+ *
+ * Just sending an IPI to each of the CPUs is also an issue, as on large
+ * count CPU machines, this can cause an IPI storm on a CPU, especially
+ * if its the only CPU with multiple RT tasks queued, and a large number
+ * of CPUs scheduling a lower priority task at the same time.
+ *
+ * Each root domain has its own irq work function that can iterate over
+ * all CPUs with RT overloaded tasks. Since all CPUs with overloaded RT
+ * tassk must be checked if there's one or many CPUs that are lowering
+ * their priority, there's a single irq work iterator that will try to
+ * push off RT tasks that are waiting to run.
+ *
+ * When a CPU schedules a lower priority task, it will kick off the
+ * irq work iterator that will jump to each CPU with overloaded RT tasks.
+ * As it only takes the first CPU that schedules a lower priority task
+ * to start the process, the rto_start variable is incremented and if
+ * the atomic result is one, then that CPU will try to take the rto_lock.
+ * This prevents high contention on the lock as the process handles all
+ * CPUs scheduling lower priority tasks.
+ *
+ * All CPUs that are scheduling a lower priority task will increment the
+ * rt_loop_next variable. This will make sure that the irq work iterator
+ * checks all RT overloaded CPUs whenever a CPU schedules a new lower
+ * priority task, even if the iterator is in the middle of a scan. Incrementing

- * When a high priority task schedules out from a CPU and a lower priority
- * task is scheduled in, a check is made to see if there's any RT tasks
- * on other CPUs that are waiting to run because a higher priority RT task
- * is currently running on its CPU. In this case, the CPU with multiple RT
- * tasks queued on it (overloaded) needs to be notified that a CPU has opened
- * up that may be able to run one of its non-running queued RT tasks.
- *
- * On large CPU boxes, there's the case that several CPUs could schedule
- * a lower priority task at the same time, in which case it will look for
- * any overloaded CPUs that it could pull a task from. To do this, the runqueue
- * lock must be taken from that overloaded CPU. Having 10s of CPUs all fighting
- * for a single overloaded CPU's runqueue lock can produce a large latency.
- * (This has actually been observed on large boxes running cyclictest).
- * Instead of taking the runqueue lock of the overloaded CPU, each of the
- * CPUs that scheduled a lower priority task simply sends an IPI to the
- * overloaded CPU. An IPI is much cheaper than taking an runqueue lock with
- * lots of contention. The overloaded CPU will look to push its non-running
- * RT task off, and if it does, it can then ignore the other IPIs coming
- * in, and just pass those IPIs off to any other overloaded CPU.
- *
- * When a CPU schedules a lower priority task, it only sends an IPI to
- * the "next" CPU that has overloaded RT tasks. This prevents IPI storms,
- * as having 10 CPUs scheduling lower priority tasks and 10 CPUs with
- * RT overloaded tasks, would cause 100 IPIs to go out at once.
- *
- * The overloaded RT CPU, when receiving an IPI, will try to push off its
- * overloaded RT tasks and then send an IPI to the next CPU that has
- * overloaded RT tasks. This stops when all CPUs with overloaded RT tasks
- * have completed. Just because a CPU may have pushed off its own overloaded
- * RT task does not mean it should stop sending the IPI around to other
- * overloaded CPUs. There may be another RT task waiting to run on one of
- * those CPUs that are of higher priority than the one that was just
- * pushed.
- *
- * An optimization that could possibly be made is to make a CPU array similar
- * to the cpupri array mask of all running RT tasks, but for the overloaded
- * case, then the IPI could be sent to only the CPU with the highest priority
- * RT task waiting, and that CPU could send off further IPIs to the CPU with
- * the next highest waiting task. Since the overloaded case is much less likely
- * to happen, the complexity of this implementation may not be worth it.
- * Instead, just send an IPI around to all overloaded CPUs.
- *
- * The rq->rt.push_flags holds the status of the IPI that is going around.
- * A run queue can only send out a single IPI at a time. The possible flags
- * for rq->rt.push_flags are:
- *
- *    (None or zero):		No IPI is going around for the current rq
- *    RT_PUSH_IPI_EXECUTING:	An IPI for the rq is being passed around
- *    RT_PUSH_IPI_RESTART:	The priority of the running task for the rq
- *				has changed, and the IPI should restart
- *				circulating the overloaded CPUs again.
- *
- * rq->rt.push_cpu contains the CPU that is being sent the IPI. It is updated
- * before sending to the next CPU.
- *
- * Instead of having all CPUs that schedule a lower priority task send
- * an IPI to the same "first" CPU in the RT overload mask, they send it
- * to the next overloaded CPU after their own CPU. This helps distribute
- * the work when there's more than one overloaded CPU and multiple CPUs
- * scheduling in lower priority tasks.
- *
- * When a rq schedules a lower priority task than what was currently
- * running, the next CPU with overloaded RT tasks is examined first.
- * That is, if CPU 1 and 5 are overloaded, and CPU 3 schedules a lower
- * priority task, it will send an IPI first to CPU 5, then CPU 5 will
- * send to CPU 1 if it is still overloaded. CPU 1 will clear the
- * rq->rt.push_flags if RT_PUSH_IPI_RESTART is not set.
- *
- * The first CPU to notice IPI_RESTART is set, will clear that flag and then
- * send an IPI to the next overloaded CPU after the rq->cpu and not the next
- * CPU after push_cpu. That is, if CPU 1, 4 and 5 are overloaded when CPU 3
- * schedules a lower priority task, and the IPI_RESTART gets set while the
- * handling is being done on CPU 5, it will clear the flag and send it back to
- * CPU 4 instead of CPU 1.
- *
- * Note, the above logic can be disabled by turning off the sched_feature
- * RT_PUSH_IPI. Then the rq lock of the overloaded CPU will simply be
- * taken by the CPU requesting a pull and the waiting RT task will be pulled
- * by that CPU. This may be fine for machines with few CPUs.

+  Copyright (C) 2011,2016 Con Kolivas.
+
+  Code based on example originally by William Pugh.
+
+Skip Lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees, as
+described in the June 1990 issue of CACM and were invented by
+William Pugh in 1987.
+
+A couple of comments about this implementation:
+The routine randomLevel has been hard-coded to generate random
+levels using p=0.25. It can be easily changed.
+
+The insertion routine has been implemented so as to use the
+dirty hack described in the CACM paper: if a random level is
+generated that is more than the current maximum level, the
+current maximum level plus one is used instead.
+
+Levels start at zero and go up to MaxLevel (which is equal to
+MaxNumberOfLevels-1).
+
+The routines defined in this file are:
+
+init: defines slnode
+
+new_skiplist: returns a new, empty list
+
+randomLevel: Returns a random level based on a u64 random seed passed to it.
+In MuQSS, the "niffy" time is used for this purpose.
+
+insert(l,key, value): inserts the binding (key, value) into l. This operation
+occurs in O(log n) time.
+
+delnode(slnode, l, node): deletes any binding of key from the l based on the
+actual node value. This operation occurs in O(k) time where k is the
+number of levels of the node in question (max 8). The original delete
+function occurred in O(log n) time and involved a search.
+
+MuQSS Notes: In this implementation of skiplists, there are bidirectional
+next/prev pointers and the insert function returns a pointer to the actual
+node the value is stored. The key here is chosen by the scheduler so as to
+sort tasks according to the priority list requirements and is no longer used
+by the scheduler after insertion. The scheduler lookup, however, occurs in
+O(1) time because it is always the first item in the level 0 linked list.
+Since the task struct stores a copy of the node pointer upon skiplist_insert,
+it can also remove it much faster than the original implementation with the
+aid of prev<->next pointer manipulation and no searching.
