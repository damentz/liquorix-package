+BFS - The Brain Fuck Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Brain Fuck Scheduler, referred to as BFS from here on, is to
+completely do away with the complex designs of the past for the cpu process
+scheduler and instead implement one that is very simple in basic design.
+The main focus of BFS is to achieve excellent desktop interactivity and
+responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are difficult to
+understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when tuned to
+one workload cause massive detriment to another.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+BFS is best described as a single runqueue, O(n) lookup, earliest effective
+virtual deadline first design, loosely based on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual
+deadline first) and my previous Staircase Deadline scheduler. Each component
+shall be described in order to understand the significance of, and reasoning for
+it. The codebase when the first stable version was released was approximately
+9000 lines less code than the existing mainline linux kernel scheduler (in
+2.6.31). This does not even take into account the removal of documentation and
+the cgroups code that is not used.
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+The single runqueue refers to the queued but not running processes for the
+entire system, regardless of the number of CPUs. The reason for going back to
+a single runqueue design is that once multiple runqueues are introduced,
+per-CPU or otherwise, there will be complex interactions as each runqueue will
+be responsible for the scheduling latency and fairness of the tasks only on its
+own runqueue, and to achieve fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any
+advantage in throughput of having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages.
+This is due to requiring a very complex balancing system to at best achieve some
+semblance of fairness across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency
+for tasks bound to the same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness
+and latency across CPUs, the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes
+for better scalability, is lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+A significant feature of BFS is that all accounting is done purely based on CPU
+used and nowhere is sleep time used in any way to determine entitlement or
+interactivity. Interactivity "estimators" that use some kind of sleep/run
+algorithm are doomed to fail to detect all interactive tasks, and to falsely tag
+tasks that aren't interactive as being so. The reason for this is that it is
+close to impossible to determine that when a task is sleeping, whether it is
+doing it voluntarily, as in a userspace application waiting for input in the
+form of a mouse click or otherwise, or involuntarily, because it is waiting for
+another thread, process, I/O, kernel activity or whatever. Thus, such an
+estimator will introduce corner cases, and more heuristics will be required to
+cope with those corner cases, introducing more corner cases and failed
+interactivity detection and so on. Interactivity in BFS is built into the design
+by virtue of the fact that tasks that are waking up have not used up their quota
+of CPU time, and have earlier effective deadlines, thereby making it very likely
+they will preempt any CPU bound task of equivalent nice level. See below for
+more information on the virtual deadline mechanism. Even if they do not preempt
+a running task, because the rr interval is guaranteed to have a bound upper
+limit on how long a task will wait for, it will be scheduled within a timeframe
+that will not cause visible interface jitter.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Task insertion.
+
+BFS inserts tasks into each relevant queue as an O(1) insertion into a double
+linked list. On insertion, *every* running queue is checked to see if the newly
+queued task can run on any idle queue, or preempt the lowest running task on the
+system. This is how the cross-CPU scheduling of BFS achieves significantly lower
+latency per extra CPU the system has. In this case the lookup is, in the worst
+case scenario, O(n) where n is the number of CPUs on the system.
+
+Data protection.
+
+BFS has one single lock protecting the process local data of every task in the
+global queue. Thus every insertion, removal and modification of task data in the
+global runqueue needs to grab the global lock. However, once a task is taken by
+a CPU, the CPU has its own local data copy of the running process' accounting
+information which only that CPU accesses and modifies (such as during a
+timer tick) thus allowing the accounting data to be updated lockless. Once a
+CPU has taken a task to run, it removes it from the global queue. Thus the
+global queue only ever has, at most,
+
+	(number of tasks requesting cpu time) - (number of logical CPUs) + 1
+
+tasks in the global queue. This value is relevant for the time taken to look up
+tasks during scheduling. This will increase if many tasks with CPU affinity set
+in their policy to limit which CPUs they're allowed to run on if they outnumber
+the number of CPUs. The +1 is because when rescheduling a task, the CPU's
+currently running task is put back on the queue. Lookup will be described after
+the virtual deadline mechanism is explained.
+
+Virtual deadline.
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in BFS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in BFS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in jiffies by this equation:
+
+	jiffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases. Once a task is descheduled, it is put back on the queue, and an
+O(n) lookup of all queued-but-not-running tasks is done to determine which has
+the earliest deadline and that task is chosen to receive CPU next.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (jiffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup.
+
+BFS has 103 priority queues. 100 of these are dedicated to the static priority
+of realtime tasks, and the remaining 3 are, in order of best to worst priority,
+SCHED_ISO (isochronous), SCHED_NORMAL, and SCHED_IDLEPRIO (idle priority
+scheduling). When a task of these priorities is queued, a bitmap of running
+priorities is set showing which of these priorities has tasks waiting for CPU
+time. When a CPU is made to reschedule, the lookup for the next task to get
+CPU time is performed in the following way:
+
+First the bitmap is checked to see what static priority tasks are queued. If
+any realtime priorities are found, the corresponding queue is checked and the
+first task listed there is taken (provided CPU affinity is suitable) and lookup
+is complete. If the priority corresponds to a SCHED_ISO task, they are also
+taken in FIFO order (as they behave like SCHED_RR). If the priority corresponds
+to either SCHED_NORMAL or SCHED_IDLEPRIO, then the lookup becomes O(n). At this
+stage, every task in the runlist that corresponds to that priority is checked
+to see which has the earliest set deadline, and (provided it has suitable CPU
+affinity) it is taken off the runqueue and given the CPU. If a task has an
+expired deadline, it is taken and the rest of the lookup aborted (as they are
+chosen in FIFO order).
+
+Thus, the lookup is O(n) in the worst case only, where n is as described
+earlier, as tasks may be chosen before the whole task list is looked over.
+
+
+Scalability.
+
+The major limitations of BFS will be that of scalability, as the separate
+runqueue designs will have less lock contention as the number of CPUs rises.
+However they do not scale linearly even with separate runqueues as multiple
+runqueues will need to be locked concurrently on such designs to be able to
+achieve fair CPU balancing, to try and achieve some sort of nice-level fairness
+across CPUs, and to achieve low enough latency for tasks on a busy CPU when
+other CPUs would be more suited. BFS has the advantage that it requires no
+balancing algorithm whatsoever, as balancing occurs by proxy simply because
+all CPUs draw off the global runqueue, in priority and deadline order. Despite
+the fact that scalability is _not_ the prime concern of BFS, it both shows very
+good scalability to smaller numbers of CPUs and is likely a more scalable design
+at these numbers of CPUs.
+
+It also has some very low overhead scalability features built into the design
+when it has been deemed their overhead is so marginal that they're worth adding.
+The first is the local copy of the running process' data to the CPU it's running
+on to allow that data to be updated lockless where possible. Then there is
+deference paid to the last CPU a task was running on, by trying that CPU first
+when looking for an idle CPU to use the next time it's scheduled. Finally there
+is the notion of cache locality beyond the last running CPU. The sched_domains
+information is used to determine the relative virtual "cache distance" that
+other CPUs have from the last CPU a task was running on. CPUs with shared
+caches, such as SMT siblings, or multicore CPUs with shared caches, are treated
+as cache local. CPUs without shared caches are treated as not cache local, and
+CPUs on different NUMA nodes are treated as very distant. This "relative cache
+distance" is used by modifying the virtual deadline value when doing lookups.
+Effectively, the deadline is unaltered between "cache local" CPUs, doubled for
+"cache distant" CPUs, and quadrupled for "very distant" CPUs. The reasoning
+behind the doubling of deadlines is as follows. The real cost of migrating a
+task from one CPU to another is entirely dependant on the cache footprint of
+the task, how cache intensive the task is, how long it's been running on that
+CPU to take up the bulk of its cache, how big the CPU cache is, how fast and
+how layered the CPU cache is, how fast a context switch is... and so on. In
+other words, it's close to random in the real world where we do more than just
+one sole workload. The only thing we can be sure of is that it's not free. So
+BFS uses the principle that an idle CPU is a wasted CPU and utilising idle CPUs
+is more important than cache locality, and cache locality only plays a part
+after that. Doubling the effective deadline is based on the premise that the
+"cache local" CPUs will tend to work on the same tasks up to double the number
+of cache local CPUs, and once the workload is beyond that amount, it is likely
+that none of the tasks are cache warm anywhere anyway. The quadrupling for NUMA
+is a value I pulled out of my arse.
+
+When choosing an idle CPU for a waking task, the cache locality is determined
+according to where the task last ran and then idle CPUs are ranked from best
+to worst to choose the most suitable idle CPU based on cache locality, NUMA
+node locality and hyperthread sibling business. They are chosen in the
+following preference (if idle):
+
+* Same core, idle or busy cache, idle threads
+* Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same core, busy threads.
+* Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+This shows the SMT or "hyperthread" awareness in the design as well which will
+choose a real idle core first before a logical SMT sibling which already has
+tasks on the physical CPU.
+
+Early benchmarking of BFS suggested scalability dropped off at the 16 CPU mark.
+However this benchmarking was performed on an earlier design that was far less
+scalable than the current one so it's hard to know how scalable it is in terms
+of both CPUs (due to the global runqueue) and heavily loaded machines (due to
+O(n) lookup) at this stage. Note that in terms of scalability, the number of
+_logical_ CPUs matters, not the number of _physical_ CPUs. Thus, a dual (2x)
+quad core (4X) hyperthreaded (2X) machine is effectively a 16X. Newer benchmark
+results are very promising indeed, without needing to tweak any knobs, features
+or options. Benchmark contributions are most welcome.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for BFS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are precisely 2 tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval
+and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO policies. In addition
+to this, BFS also uses sub-tick accounting. What BFS does _not_ now feature is
+support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither need to know what these
+are, nor should they need to be using them to have good desktop behaviour.
+
+rr_interval
+
+There is only one "scheduler" tunable, the round robin interval. This can be
+accessed in
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6 on a
+uniprocessor machine, and automatically set to a progressively higher value on
+multiprocessor machines. The reasoning behind increasing the value on more CPUs
+is that the effective latency is decreased by virtue of there being more CPUs on
+BFS (for reasons explained above), and increasing the value allows for less
+cache contention and more throughput. Valid values are from 1 to 1000
+Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of decreasing
+throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the cost of
+worsening latencies. The accuracy of the rr interval is limited by HZ resolution
+of the kernel configuration. Thus, the worst case latencies are usually slightly
+higher than this actual value. The default value of 6 is not an arbitrary one.
+It is based on the fact that humans can detect jitter at approximately 7ms, so
+aiming for much lower latencies is pointless under most circumstances. It is
+worth noting this fact when comparing the latency performance of BFS to other
+schedulers. Worst case latencies being higher than 7ms are far worse than
+average latencies not being in the microsecond range.
+
+Isochronous scheduling.
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of _total CPU_ available across the machine, configurable
+as a percentage in the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a
+scheduler tunable):
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of BFS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+Because some applications constantly set their policy as well as their nice
+level, there is potential for them to undo the override specified by the user
+on the command line of setting the policy to SCHED_ISO. To counter this, once
+a task has been set to SCHED_ISO policy, it needs superuser privileges to set
+it back to SCHED_NORMAL. This will ensure the task remains ISO and all child
+processes and threads will also inherit the ISO policy.
+
+Idleprio scheduling.
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start
+a video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this
+policy from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it
+detects a state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to
+suspend to ram and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. As
+per the Isochronous task management, once a task has been scheduled as IDLEPRIO,
+it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without superuser privileges. Tasks can
+be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+	schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting.
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the
+timer tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application
+which uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records
+zero CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible
+security implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task
+really does use. BFS tries to use the sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock,
+where possible, to determine real CPU usage. This is not entirely reliable, but
+is far more likely to produce accurate CPU usage data than the existing designs
+and will not show tasks as consuming no CPU usage when they actually are. Thus,
+the amount of CPU reported as being used by BFS will more accurately represent
+how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for example by the 'time'
+application), so the reported values may be quite different to other schedulers.
+Values reported as the 'load' are more prone to problems with this design, but
+per process values are closer to real usage. When comparing throughput of BFS
+to other designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms
+of total wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported
+"cpu usage".

+MuQSS - The Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+MuQSS is a per-cpu runqueue variant of the original BFS scheduler with
+one 8 level skiplist per runqueue, and fine grained locking for much more
+scalability.
+
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler, referred to as MuQSS from
+here on (pronounced mux) is to completely do away with the complex designs of
+the past for the cpu process scheduler and instead implement one that is very
+simple in basic design. The main focus of MuQSS is to achieve excellent desktop
+interactivity and responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are
+difficult to understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when
+tuned to one workload cause massive detriment to another, while still being
+scalable to many CPUs and processes.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+MuQSS is best described as per-cpu multiple runqueue, O(log n) insertion, O(1)
+lookup, earliest effective virtual deadline first tickless design, loosely based
+on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual deadline first) and my previous Staircase
+Deadline scheduler, and evolved from the single runqueue O(n) BFS scheduler.
+Each component shall be described in order to understand the significance of,
+and reasoning for it.
+
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+In BFS, the use of a single runqueue across all CPUs meant that each CPU would
+need to scan the entire runqueue looking for the process with the earliest
+deadline and schedule that next, regardless of which CPU it originally came
+from. This made BFS deterministic with respect to latency and provided
+guaranteed latencies dependent on number of processes and CPUs. The single
+runqueue, however, meant that all CPUs would compete for the single lock
+protecting it, which would lead to increasing lock contention as the number of
+CPUs rose and appeared to limit scalability of common workloads beyond 16
+logical CPUs. Additionally, the O(n) lookup of the runqueue list obviously
+increased overhead proportionate to the number of queued proecesses and led to
+cache thrashing while iterating over the linked list.
+
+MuQSS is an evolution of BFS, designed to maintain the same scheduling
+decision mechanism and be virtually deterministic without relying on the
+constrained design of the single runqueue by splitting out the single runqueue
+to be per-CPU and use skiplists instead of linked lists.
+
+The original reason for going back to a single runqueue design for BFS was that
+once multiple runqueues are introduced, per-CPU or otherwise, there will be
+complex interactions as each runqueue will be responsible for the scheduling
+latency and fairness of the tasks only on its own runqueue, and to achieve
+fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any advantage in throughput of
+having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages. This is due to requiring a
+very complex balancing system to at best achieve some semblance of fairness
+across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency for tasks bound to the
+same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness and latency across CPUs,
+the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes for better scalability, is
+lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+MuQSS works around the problems inherent in multiple runqueue designs by
+making its skip lists priority ordered and through novel use of lockless
+examination of each other runqueue it can decide if it should take the earliest
+deadline task from another runqueue for latency reasons, or for CPU balancing
+reasons. It still does not have a balancing system, choosing to allow the
+next task scheduling decision and task wakeup CPU choice to allow balancing to
+happen by virtue of its choices.
+
+As a further evolution of the design, MuQSS normally configures sharing of
+runqueues in a logical fashion for when CPU resources are shared for improved
+latency and throughput. By default it shares runqueues and locks between
+multicore siblings. Optionally it can be configured to run with sharing of
+SMT siblings only, all SMP packages or no sharing at all. Additionally it can
+be selected at boot time.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Custom skip list implementation:
+
+To avoid the overhead of building up and tearing down skip list structures,
+the variant used by MuQSS has a number of optimisations making it specific for
+its use case in the scheduler. It uses static arrays of 8 'levels' instead of
+building up and tearing down structures dynamically. This makes each runqueue
+only scale O(log N) up to 64k tasks. However as there is one runqueue per CPU
+it means that it scales O(log N) up to 64k x number of logical CPUs which is
+far beyond the realistic task limits each CPU could handle. By being 8 levels
+it also makes the array exactly one cacheline in size. Additionally, each
+skip list node is bidirectional making insertion and removal amortised O(1),
+being O(k) where k is 1-8. Uniquely, we are only ever interested in the very
+first entry in each list at all times with MuQSS, so there is never a need to
+do a search and thus look up is always O(1). In interactive mode, the queues
+will be searched beyond their first entry if the first task is not suitable
+for affinity or SMT nice reasons.
+
+Task insertion:
+
+MuQSS inserts tasks into a per CPU runqueue as an O(log N) insertion into
+a custom skip list as described above (based on the original design by William
+Pugh). Insertion is ordered in such a way that there is never a need to do a
+search by ordering tasks according to static priority primarily, and then
+virtual deadline at the time of insertion.
+
+Niffies:
+
+Niffies are a monotonic forward moving timer not unlike the "jiffies" but are
+of nanosecond resolution. Niffies are calculated per-runqueue from the high
+resolution TSC timers, and in order to maintain fairness are synchronised
+between CPUs whenever both runqueues are locked concurrently.
+
+Virtual deadline:
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in MuQSS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in MuQSS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in niffies by this equation:
+
+	niffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (niffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup:
+
+As tasks are already pre-ordered according to anticipated scheduling order in
+the skip lists, lookup for the next suitable task per-runqueue is always a
+matter of simply selecting the first task in the 0th level skip list entry.
+In order to maintain optimal latency and fairness across CPUs, MuQSS does a
+novel examination of every other runqueue in cache locality order, choosing the
+best task across all runqueues. This provides near-determinism of how long any
+task across the entire system may wait before receiving CPU time. The other
+runqueues are first examine lockless and then trylocked to minimise the
+potential lock contention if they are likely to have a suitable better task.
+Each other runqueue lock is only held for as long as it takes to examine the
+entry for suitability. In "interactive" mode, the default setting, MuQSS will
+look for the best deadline task across all CPUs, while in !interactive mode,
+it will only select a better deadline task from another CPU if it is more
+heavily laden than the current one.
+
+Lookup is therefore O(k) where k is number of CPUs.
+
+
+Latency.
+
+Through the use of virtual deadlines to govern the scheduling order of normal
+tasks, queue-to-activation latency per runqueue is guaranteed to be bound by
+the rr_interval tunable which is set to 6ms by default. This means that the
+longest a CPU bound task will wait for more CPU is proportional to the number
+of running tasks and in the common case of 0-2 running tasks per CPU, will be
+under the 7ms threshold for human perception of jitter. Additionally, as newly
+woken tasks will have an early deadline from their previous runtime, the very
+tasks that are usually latency sensitive will have the shortest interval for
+activation, usually preempting any existing CPU bound tasks.
+
+Tickless expiry:
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it is not tied to the resolution of the chosen tick
+rate in Hz, instead depending entirely on the high resolution timers where
+possible for sub-millisecond accuracy on timeouts regarless of the underlying
+tick rate. This allows MuQSS to be run with the low overhead of low Hz rates
+such as 100 by default, benefiting from the improved throughput and lower
+power usage it provides. Another advantage of this approach is that in
+combination with the Full No HZ option, which disables ticks on running task
+CPUs instead of just idle CPUs, the tick can be disabled at all times
+regardless of how many tasks are running instead of being limited to just one
+running task. Note that this option is NOT recommended for regular desktop
+users.
+
+
+Scalability and balancing.
+
+Unlike traditional approaches where balancing is a combination of CPU selection
+at task wakeup and intermittent balancing based on a vast array of rules set
+according to architecture, busyness calculations and special case management,
+MuQSS indirectly balances on the fly at task wakeup and next task selection.
+During initialisation, MuQSS creates a cache coherency ordered list of CPUs for
+each logical CPU and uses this to aid task/CPU selection when CPUs are busy.
+Additionally it selects any idle CPUs, if they are available, at any time over
+busy CPUs according to the following preference:
+
+ * Same thread, idle or busy cache, idle or busy threads
+ * Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+Mux is therefore SMT, MC and Numa aware without the need for extra
+intermittent balancing to maintain CPUs busy and make the most of cache
+coherency.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for MuQSS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are 3 optional tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval,
+interactive, and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO
+policies. In addition to this, MuQSS also uses sub-tick accounting. What MuQSS
+does _not_ now feature is support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither
+need to know what these are, nor should they need to be using them to have good
+desktop behaviour. However since some applications refuse to work without
+cgroups, one can enable them with MuQSS as a stub and the filesystem will be
+created which will allow the applications to work.
+
+rr_interval:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6. Valid values
+are from 1 to 1000 Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of
+decreasing throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the
+cost of worsening latencies. It is based on the fact that humans can detect
+jitter at approximately 7ms, so aiming for much lower latencies is pointless
+under most circumstances. It is worth noting this fact when comparing the
+latency performance of MuQSS to other schedulers. Worst case latencies being
+higher than 7ms are far worse than average latencies not being in the
+microsecond range.
+
+interactive:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/interactive
+
+The value is a simple boolean of 1 for on and 0 for off and is set to on by
+default. Disabling this will disable the near-determinism of MuQSS when
+selecting the next task by not examining all CPUs for the earliest deadline
+task, or which CPU to wake to, instead prioritising CPU balancing for improved
+throughput. Latency will still be bound by rr_interval, but on a per-CPU basis
+instead of across the whole system.
+
+Runqueue sharing.
+
+By default MuQSS chooses to share runqueue resources (specifically the skip
+list and locking) between multicore siblings. It is configurable at build time
+to select between None, SMT, MC and SMP, corresponding to no sharing, sharing
+only between simultaneous mulithreading siblings, multicore siblings, or
+symmetric multiprocessing physical packages. Additionally it can be se at
+bootime with the use of the rqshare parameter. The reason for configurability
+is that some architectures have CPUs with many multicore siblings (>= 16)
+where it may be detrimental to throughput to share runqueues and another
+sharing option may be desirable. Additionally, more sharing than usual can
+improve latency on a system-wide level at the expense of throughput if desired.
+
+The options are:
+none, smt, mc, smp
+
+eg:
+	rqshare=mc
+
+Isochronous scheduling:
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of CPU available per CPU, configurable as a percentage in
+the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a scheduler tunable):
+
+iso_cpu:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+
+
+Idleprio scheduling:
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start a
+video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this policy
+from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it detects a
+state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to suspend to ram
+and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. Once a task has
+been scheduled as IDLEPRIO, it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without
+superuser privileges since it is effectively a lower scheduling policy. Tasks
+can be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting:
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the timer
+tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application which
+uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records zero
+CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible security
+implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task really does
+use. Mux uses sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock to determine real CPU
+usage. Thus, the amount of CPU reported as being used by MuQSS will more
+accurately represent how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for
+example by the 'time' application), so the reported values may be quite
+different to other schedulers. When comparing throughput of MuQSS to other
+designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms of total
+wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported "cpu usage".
+
+Symmetric MultiThreading (SMT) aware nice:
+
+SMT, a.k.a. hyperthreading, is a very common feature on modern CPUs. While the
+logical CPU count rises by adding thread units to each CPU core, allowing more
+than one task to be run simultaneously on the same core, the disadvantage of it
+is that the CPU power is shared between the tasks, not summating to the power
+of two CPUs. The practical upshot of this is that two tasks running on
+separate threads of the same core run significantly slower than if they had one
+core each to run on. While smart CPU selection allows each task to have a core
+to itself whenever available (as is done on MuQSS), it cannot offset the
+slowdown that occurs when the cores are all loaded and only a thread is left.
+Most of the time this is harmless as the CPU is effectively overloaded at this
+point and the extra thread is of benefit. However when running a niced task in
+the presence of an un-niced task (say nice 19 v nice 0), the nice task gets
+precisely the same amount of CPU power as the unniced one. MuQSS has an
+optional configuration feature known as SMT-NICE which selectively idles the
+secondary niced thread for a period proportional to the nice difference,
+allowing CPU distribution according to nice level to be maintained, at the
+expense of a small amount of extra overhead. If this is configured in on a
+machine without SMT threads, the overhead is minimal.

+Description
+-----------
+
+ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS
+(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
+hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.
+
+This driver exposes some features of the SMAPI BIOS through a sysfs
+interface. It is suitable for newer models, on which SMAPI is invoked
+through IO port writes. Older models use a different SMAPI interface;
+for those, try the "thinkpad" module from the "tpctl" package.
+
+WARNING:
+This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
+It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
+(especially on models it wasn't tested on).
+
+
+Module parameters
+-----------------
+
+thinkpad_ec module:
+  force_io=1 lets thinkpad_ec load on some recent ThinkPad models
+  (e.g., T400 and T500) whose BIOS's ACPI DSDT reserves the ports we need.
+tp_smapi module:
+  debug=1    enables verbose dmesg output.
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+Control of battery charging thresholds (in percents of current full charge
+capacity):
+
+# echo 40 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh
+# echo 70 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/*_charge_thresh
+
+    (This is useful since Li-Ion batteries wear out much faster at very
+     high or low charge levels. The driver will also keeps the thresholds
+     across suspend-to-disk with AC disconnected; this isn't done
+     automatically by the hardware.)
+
+Inhibiting battery charging for 17 minutes (overrides thresholds):
+
+# echo 17 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+# echo 0  > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes  # stop
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+
+    (This can be used to control which battery is charged when using an
+     Ultrabay battery.)
+
+Forcing battery discharging even if AC power available:
+
+# echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # start discharge
+# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # stop discharge
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge
+
+    (When AC is connected, forced discharging will automatically stop
+     when battery is fully depleted -- this is useful for calibration.
+     Also, this attribute can be used to control which battery is discharged
+     when both a system battery and an Ultrabay battery are connected.)

+
+The BAT0/group{0,1,2,3}_voltage attribute refers to the separate cell groups
+in each battery. For example, on the ThinkPad 600, X3x, T4x and R5x models,
+the battery contains 3 cell groups in series, where each group consisting of 2
+or 3 cells  connected in parallel. The voltage of each group is given by these
+attributes, and their sum (roughly) equals the "voltage" attribute.
+(The effective performance of the battery is determined by the weakest group,
+i.e., the one those voltage changes most rapidly during dis/charging.)
+
+The "BAT0/dump" attribute gives a a hex dump of the raw status data, which
+contains additional data now in the above (if you can figure it out). Some
+unused values are autodetected and replaced by "--":
+
+In all of the above, replace BAT0 with BAT1 to address the 2nd battery (e.g.
+in the UltraBay).
+
+
+Raw SMAPI calls:
+
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+This performs raw SMAPI calls. It uses a bad interface that cannot handle
+multiple simultaneous access. Don't touch it, it's for development only.
+If you did touch it, you would so something like
+# echo '211a 100 0 0' > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+and notice that in the output "211a 34b b2 0 0 0 'OK'", the "4b" in the 2nd
+value, converted to decimal is 75: the current charge stop threshold.
+
+
+Model-specific status
+---------------------
+
+Works (at least partially) on the following ThinkPad model:
+* A30
+* G41
+* R40, R50p, R51, R52
+* T23, T40, T40p, T41, T41p, T42, T42p, T43, T43p, T60, T61, T400, T410, T420 (partially)
+* X24, X31, X32, X40, X41, X60, X61, X200, X201, X220 (partially)
+* Z60t, Z61m
+
+Does not work on:
+* X230 and newer
+* T430 and newer
+* Any ThinkPad Edge
+* Any ThinkPad Yoga
+* Any ThinkPad L series
+* Any ThinkPad P series
+
+Not all functions are available on all models; for detailed status, see:
+  http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi
+
+Please report success/failure by e-mail or on the Wiki.
+If you get a "not implemented" or "not supported" message, your laptop
+probably just can't do that (at least not via the SMAPI BIOS).
+For negative reports, follow the bug reporting guidelines below.
+If you send me the necessary technical data (i.e., SMAPI function
+interfaces), I will support additional models.
+
+
+Additional HDAPS features
+-------------------------
+
+The modified hdaps driver has several improvements on the one in mainline
+(beyond resolving the conflict with thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi):
+
+- Fixes reliability and improves support for recent ThinkPad models
+  (especially *60 and newer). Unlike the mainline driver, the modified hdaps
+  correctly follows the Embedded Controller communication protocol.
+
+- Extends the "invert" parameter to cover all possible axis orientations.
+  The possible values are as follows.
+  Let X,Y denote the hardware readouts.
+  Let R denote the laptop's roll (tilt left/right).
+  Let P denote the laptop's pitch (tilt forward/backward).
+    invert=0:   R= X  P= Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=1:   R=-X  P=-Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=2:   R=-X  P= Y   (new)
+    invert=3:   R= X  P=-Y   (new)
+    invert=4:   R= Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=5:   R=-Y  P=-X   (new)
+    invert=6:   R=-Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=7:   R= Y  P=-X   (new)
+  It's probably easiest to just try all 8 possibilities and see which yields
+  correct results (e.g., in the hdaps-gl visualisation).
+
+- Adds a whitelist which automatically sets the correct axis orientation for
+  some models. If the value for your model is wrong or missing, you can override
+  it using the "invert" parameter. Please also update the tables at
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi and
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/List_of_DMI_IDs
+  and submit a patch for the whitelist in hdaps.c.
+
+- Provides new attributes:
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/sampling_rate:
+    This determines the frequency at which the host queries the embedded
+    controller for accelerometer data (and informs the hdaps input devices).
+    Default=50.
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/oversampling_ratio:
+    When set to X, the embedded controller is told to do physical accelerometer
+    measurements at a rate that is X times higher than the rate at which
+    the driver reads those measurements (i.e., X*sampling_rate). This
+    makes the readouts from the embedded controller more fresh, and is also
+    useful for the running average filter (see next). Default=5
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/running_avg_filter_order:
+    When set to X, reported readouts will be the average of the last X physical
+    accelerometer measurements. Current firmware allows 1<=X<=8. Setting to a
+    high value decreases readout fluctuations. The averaging is handled by the
+    embedded controller, so no CPU resources are used. Higher values make the
+    readouts smoother, since it averages out both sensor noise (good) and abrupt
+    changes (bad). Default=2.
+
+- Provides a second input device, which publishes the raw accelerometer
+  measurements (without the fuzzing needed for joystick emulation). This input
+  device can be matched by a udev rule such as the following (all on one line):
+    KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{phys}=="hdaps/input1",
+    ATTRS{modalias}=="input:b0019v1014p5054e4801-*",
+    SYMLINK+="input/hdaps/accelerometer-event
+
+A new version of the hdapsd userspace daemon, which uses the input device
+interface instead of polling sysfs, is available seprately. Using this reduces
+the total interrupts per second generated by hdaps+hdapsd (on tickless kernels)
+to 50, down from a value that fluctuates between 50 and 100. Set the
+sampling_rate sysfs attribute to a lower value to further reduce interrupts,
+at the expense of response latency.
+
+Licensing note: all my changes to the HDAPS driver are licensed under the
+GPL version 2 or, at your option and to the extent allowed by derivation from
+prior works, any later version. My version of hdaps is derived work from the
+mainline version, which at the time of writing is available only under
+GPL version 2.
+
+Bug reporting
+-------------
+
+Mail <multinymous@gmail.com>. Please include:
+* Details about your model,
+* Relevant "dmesg" output. Make sure thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi are loaded with
+  the "debug=1" parameter (e.g., use "make load HDAPS=1 DEBUG=1").
+* Output of "dmidecode | grep -C5 Product"
+* Does the failed functionality works under Windows?
+
+
+More about SMAPI
+----------------
+
+For hints about what may be possible via the SMAPI BIOS and how, see:
+
+* IBM Technical Reference Manual for the ThinkPad 770
+  (http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=PFAN-3TUQQD)
+* Exported symbols in PWRMGRIF.DLL or TPPWRW32.DLL (e.g., use "objdump -x").
+* drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c in the Linux kernel tree.*
+* The "thinkpad" SMAPI module (http://tpctl.sourceforge.net).
+* The SMAPI_* constants in tp_smapi.c.
+
+Note that in the above Technical Reference and in the "thinkpad" module,
+SMAPI is invoked through a function call to some physical address. However,
+the interface used by tp_smapi and the above mwave drive, and apparently
+required by newer ThinkPad, is different: you set the parameters up in the
+CPU's registers and write to ports 0xB2 (the APM control port) and 0x4F; this
+triggers an SMI (System Management Interrupt), causing the CPU to enter
+SMM (System Management Mode) and run the BIOS firmware; the results are
+returned in the CPU's registers. It is not clear what is the relation between
+the two variants of SMAPI, though the assignment of error codes seems to be
+similar.
+
+In addition, the embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard
+interface at IO ports 0x1600-0x161F (mapped to LCP channel 3 of the H8S chip).
+The interface provides various system management services (currently known:
+battery information and accelerometer readouts). For more information see the
+thinkpad_ec module and the H8S hardware documentation:
+http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/mpumcu/rej09b0300_2140bhm.pdf

-	 * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive

-	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
-	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the

-	 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
-	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
-	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
-	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
-	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
-	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
-	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
-	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
-	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
-	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
-	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
-	 * symmetric scenario where:
-	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
-	 *      the others;
-	 * (ii) the I/O of each process has the same properties, in
-	 *      terms of locality (sequential or random), direction
-	 *      (reads or writes), request sizes, greediness
-	 *      (from I/O-bound to sporadic), and so on.
-	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive tends to treat
-	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
-	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
-	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
-	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
-	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
-	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
-	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
-	 * details).
-	 * The problem is that idling may significantly reduce
-	 * throughput with certain combinations of types of I/O and
-	 * devices. An important example is sync random I/O, on flash
-	 * storage with command queueing. So, unless bfqq falls in the
-	 * above cases where idling also boosts throughput, it would
-	 * be important to check conditions (i) and (ii) accurately,
-	 * so as to avoid idling when not strictly needed for service
-	 * guarantees.
-	 *
-	 * Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to thoroughly
-	 * check condition (ii). And, in case there are active groups,
-	 * it becomes very difficult to check condition (i) too. In
-	 * fact, if there are active groups, then, for condition (i)
-	 * to become false, it is enough that an active group contains
-	 * more active processes or sub-groups than some other active
-	 * group. More precisely, for condition (i) to hold because of

-	 * has become inactive, some of its descendant processes still
-	 * have some request already dispatched but still waiting for
-	 * completion. In fact, requests have still to be guaranteed
-	 * their share of the throughput even after being
-	 * dispatched. In this respect, it is easy to show that, if a
-	 * group frequently becomes inactive while still having
-	 * in-flight requests, and if, when this happens, the group is
-	 * not considered in the calculation of whether the scenario
-	 * is asymmetric, then the group may fail to be guaranteed its
-	 * fair share of the throughput (basically because idling may
-	 * not be performed for the descendant processes of the group,
-	 * but it had to be).  We address this issue with the
-	 * following bi-modal behavior, implemented in the function
-	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario().
-	 *
-	 * If there are groups with requests waiting for completion
-	 * (as commented above, some of these groups may even be
-	 * already inactive), then the scenario is tagged as
-	 * asymmetric, conservatively, without checking any of the
-	 * conditions (i) and (ii). So the device is idled for bfqq.
-	 * This behavior matches also the fact that groups are created
-	 * exactly if controlling I/O is a primary concern (to
-	 * preserve bandwidth and latency guarantees).
-	 *
-	 * On the opposite end, if there are no groups with requests
-	 * waiting for completion, then only condition (i) is actually
-	 * controlled, i.e., provided that condition (i) holds, idling
-	 * is not performed, regardless of whether condition (ii)
-	 * holds. In other words, only if condition (i) does not hold,
-	 * then idling is allowed, and the device tends to be
-	 * prevented from queueing many requests, possibly of several
-	 * processes. Since there are no groups with requests waiting
-	 * for completion, then, to control condition (i) it is enough
-	 * to check just whether all the queues with requests waiting
-	 * for completion also have the same weight.
-	 *
-	 * Not checking condition (ii) evidently exposes bfqq to the
-	 * risk of getting less throughput than its fair share.
-	 * However, for queues with the same weight, a further
-	 * mechanism, preemption, mitigates or even eliminates this
-	 * problem. And it does so without consequences on overall
-	 * throughput. This mechanism and its benefits are explained
-	 * in the next three paragraphs.
-	 *
-	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
-	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
-	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
-	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
-	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
-	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
-	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
-	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
-	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
-	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
-	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
-	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
-	 * minimum of mid-term fairness.
-	 *
-	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
-	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
-	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
-	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
-	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
-	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
-	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
-	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
-	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
-	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
-	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
-	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
-	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
-	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
-	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
-	 * queue.
-	 *
-	 * The motivation for using preemption instead of idling (for
-	 * queues with the same weight) is that, by not idling,
-	 * service guarantees are preserved (completely or at least in
-	 * part) without minimally sacrificing throughput. And, if
-	 * there is no active group, then the primary expectation for
-	 * this device is probably a high throughput.
-	 *
-	 * We are now left only with explaining the additional
-	 * compound condition that is checked below for deciding
-	 * whether the scenario is asymmetric. To explain this
-	 * compound condition, we need to add that the function
-	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario checks the weights of only
-	 * non-weight-raised queues, for efficiency reasons (see
-	 * comments on bfq_weights_tree_add()). Then the fact that
-	 * bfqq is weight-raised is checked explicitly here. More
-	 * precisely, the compound condition below takes into account
-	 * also the fact that, even if bfqq is being weight-raised,
-	 * the scenario is still symmetric if all queues with requests
-	 * waiting for completion happen to be
-	 * weight-raised. Actually, we should be even more precise
-	 * here, and differentiate between interactive weight raising
-	 * and soft real-time weight raising.
-	 *
-	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
-	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
-	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
-	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
-	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to

+/*
+ * There is a case where idling does not have to be performed for
+ * throughput concerns, but to preserve the throughput share of
+ * the process associated with bfqq.
+ *
+ * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
+ * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
+ * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+ * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+ * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+ * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+ * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+ * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+ * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+ * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+ * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+ * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+ * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+ * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+ * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired throughput
+ * distribution only in a completely symmetric, or favorably
+ * skewed scenario where:
+ * (i-a) each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+ *	 the others,
+ * (i-b) in case (i-a) does not hold, it holds that the process
+ *       associated with bfqq must receive a lower or equal
+ *	 throughput than any of the other processes;
+ * (ii)  the I/O of each process has the same properties, in
+ *       terms of locality (sequential or random), direction
+ *       (reads or writes), request sizes, greediness
+ *       (from I/O-bound to sporadic), and so on;
+
+ * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive tends to treat the requests
+ * of each process in about the same way as the requests of the
+ * others, and thus to provide each of these processes with about the
+ * same throughput.  This is exactly the desired throughput
+ * distribution if (i-a) holds, or, if (i-b) holds instead, this is an
+ * even more convenient distribution for (the process associated with)
+ * bfqq.
+ *
+ * In contrast, in any asymmetric or unfavorable scenario, device
+ * idling (I/O-dispatch plugging) is certainly needed to guarantee
+ * that bfqq receives its assigned fraction of the device throughput
+ * (see [1] for details).
+ *
+ * The problem is that idling may significantly reduce throughput with
+ * certain combinations of types of I/O and devices. An important
+ * example is sync random I/O on flash storage with command
+ * queueing. So, unless bfqq falls in cases where idling also boosts
+ * throughput, it is important to check conditions (i-a), i(-b) and
+ * (ii) accurately, so as to avoid idling when not strictly needed for
+ * service guarantees.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to thoroughly check
+ * condition (ii). And, in case there are active groups, it becomes
+ * very difficult to check conditions (i-a) and (i-b) too.  In fact,
+ * if there are active groups, then, for conditions (i-a) or (i-b) to
+ * become false 'indirectly', it is enough that an active group
+ * contains more active processes or sub-groups than some other active
+ * group. More precisely, for conditions (i-a) or (i-b) to become
+ * false because of such a group, it is not even necessary that the
+ * group is (still) active: it is sufficient that, even if the group
+ * has become inactive, some of its descendant processes still have
+ * some request already dispatched but still waiting for
+ * completion. In fact, requests have still to be guaranteed their
+ * share of the throughput even after being dispatched. In this

+/*
+ * The processes associated with bfqq may happen to generate their
+ * cumulative I/O at a lower rate than the rate at which the device
+ * could serve the same I/O. This is rather probable, e.g., if only
+ * one process is associated with bfqq and the device is an SSD. It
+ * results in bfqq becoming often empty while in service. In this
+ * respect, if BFQ is allowed to switch to another queue when bfqq
+ * remains empty, then the device goes on being fed with I/O requests,
+ * and the throughput is not affected. In contrast, if BFQ is not
+ * allowed to switch to another queue---because bfqq is sync and
+ * I/O-dispatch needs to be plugged while bfqq is temporarily
+ * empty---then, during the service of bfqq, there will be frequent
+ * "service holes", i.e., time intervals during which bfqq gets empty
+ * and the device can only consume the I/O already queued in its
+ * hardware queues. During service holes, the device may even get to
+ * remaining idle. In the end, during the service of bfqq, the device
+ * is driven at a lower speed than the one it can reach with the kind
+ * of I/O flowing through bfqq.
+ *
+ * To counter this loss of throughput, BFQ implements a "request
+ * injection mechanism", which tries to fill the above service holes
+ * with I/O requests taken from other queues. The hard part in this
+ * mechanism is finding the right amount of I/O to inject, so as to
+ * both boost throughput and not break bfqq's bandwidth and latency
+ * guarantees. In this respect, the mechanism maintains a per-queue
+ * inject limit, computed as below. While bfqq is empty, the injection
+ * mechanism dispatches extra I/O requests only until the total number
+ * of I/O requests in flight---i.e., already dispatched but not yet
+ * completed---remains lower than this limit.
+ *
+ * A first definition comes in handy to introduce the algorithm by
+ * which the inject limit is computed.  We define as first request for
+ * bfqq, an I/O request for bfqq that arrives while bfqq is in
+ * service, and causes bfqq to switch from empty to non-empty. The
+ * algorithm updates the limit as a function of the effect of
+ * injection on the service times of only the first requests of
+ * bfqq. The reason for this restriction is that these are the
+ * requests whose service time is affected most, because they are the
+ * first to arrive after injection possibly occurred.
+ *
+ * To evaluate the effect of injection, the algorithm measures the
+ * "total service time" of first requests. We define as total service
+ * time of an I/O request, the time that elapses since when the
+ * request is enqueued into bfqq, to when it is completed. This
+ * quantity allows the whole effect of injection to be measured. It is
+ * easy to see why. Suppose that some requests of other queues are
+ * actually injected while bfqq is empty, and that a new request R
+ * then arrives for bfqq. If the device does start to serve all or
+ * part of the injected requests during the service hole, then,
+ * because of this extra service, it may delay the next invocation of
+ * the dispatch hook of BFQ. Then, even after R gets eventually
+ * dispatched, the device may delay the actual service of R if it is
+ * still busy serving the extra requests, or if it decides to serve,
+ * before R, some extra request still present in its queues. As a
+ * conclusion, the cumulative extra delay caused by injection can be
+ * easily evaluated by just comparing the total service time of first
+ * requests with and without injection.
+ *
+ * The limit-update algorithm works as follows. On the arrival of a
+ * first request of bfqq, the algorithm measures the total time of the
+ * request only if one of the three cases below holds, and, for each
+ * case, it updates the limit as described below:
+ *
+ * (1) If there is no in-flight request. This gives a baseline for the
+ *     total service time of the requests of bfqq. If the baseline has
+ *     not been computed yet, then, after computing it, the limit is
+ *     set to 1, to start boosting throughput, and to prepare the
+ *     ground for the next case. If the baseline has already been
+ *     computed, then it is updated, in case it results to be lower
+ *     than the previous value.
+ *
+ * (2) If the limit is higher than 0 and there are in-flight
+ *     requests. By comparing the total service time in this case with
+ *     the above baseline, it is possible to know at which extent the
+ *     current value of the limit is inflating the total service
+ *     time. If the inflation is below a certain threshold, then bfqq
+ *     is assumed to be suffering from no perceivable loss of its
+ *     service guarantees, and the limit is even tentatively
+ *     increased. If the inflation is above the threshold, then the
+ *     limit is decreased. Due to the lack of any hysteresis, this
+ *     logic makes the limit oscillate even in steady workload
+ *     conditions. Yet we opted for it, because it is fast in reaching
+ *     the best value for the limit, as a function of the current I/O
+ *     workload. To reduce oscillations, this step is disabled for a
+ *     short time interval after the limit happens to be decreased.
+ *
+ * (3) Periodically, after resetting the limit, to make sure that the
+ *     limit eventually drops in case the workload changes. This is
+ *     needed because, after the limit has gone safely up for a
+ *     certain workload, it is impossible to guess whether the
+ *     baseline total service time may have changed, without measuring
+ *     it again without injection. A more effective version of this
+ *     step might be to just sample the baseline, by interrupting
+ *     injection only once, and then to reset/lower the limit only if
+ *     the total service time with the current limit does happen to be
+ *     too large.
+ *
+ * More details on each step are provided in the comments on the
+ * pieces of code that implement these steps: the branch handling the
+ * transition from empty to non empty in bfq_add_request(), the branch
+ * handling injection in bfq_select_queue(), and the function
+ * bfq_choose_bfqq_for_injection(). These comments also explain some
+ * exceptions, made by the injection mechanism in some special cases.

+/*
+ *  tp_smapi.c - ThinkPad SMAPI support
+ *
+ *  This driver exposes some features of the System Management Application
+ *  Program Interface (SMAPI) BIOS found on ThinkPad laptops. It works on
+ *  models in which the SMAPI BIOS runs in SMM and is invoked by writing
+ *  to the APM control port 0xB2.
+ *  It also exposes battery status information, obtained from the ThinkPad
+ *  embedded controller (via the thinkpad_ec module).
+ *  Ancient ThinkPad models use a different interface, supported by the
+ *  "thinkpad" module from "tpctl".
+ *
+ *  Many of the battery status values obtained from the EC simply mirror
+ *  values provided by the battery's Smart Battery System (SBS) interface, so
+ *  their meaning is defined by the Smart Battery Data Specification (see
+ *  http://sbs-forum.org/specs/sbdat110.pdf). References to this SBS spec
+ *  are given in the code where relevant.

+
+	help
+	  With this option enabled, the CPU scheduler will have one runqueue
+	  shared by SMT (hyperthread) siblings. As these logical cores share
+	  one physical core, sharing the runqueue resource can lead to decreased
+	  overhead, lower latency and higher throughput.
+
+	  This can still be enabled runtime with the boot parameter
+	  rqshare=smt
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config RQ_MC
+	bool "Multicore siblings"
+	depends on SCHED_MC && SCHED_MUQSS
+	help
+	  With this option enabled, the CPU scheduler will have one runqueue
+	  shared by multicore siblings in addition to any SMT siblings.
+	  As these physical cores share caches, sharing the runqueue resource
+	  will lead to lower latency, but its effects on overhead and throughput
+	  are less predictable. As a general rule, 6 or fewer cores will likely
+	  benefit from this, while larger CPUs will only derive a latency
+	  benefit. If your workloads are primarily single threaded, this will
+	  possibly worsen throughput. If you are only concerned about latency
+	  then enable this regardless of how many cores you have.
+
+	  This can still be enabled runtime with the boot parameter
+	  rqshare=mc
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
+
+config RQ_SMP
+	bool "Symmetric Multi-Processing"
+	depends on SMP && SCHED_MUQSS
+	help
+	  With this option enabled, the CPU scheduler will have one runqueue
+	  shared by all physical CPUs unless they are on separate NUMA nodes.
+	  As physical CPUs usually do not share resources, sharing the runqueue
+	  will normally worsen throughput but improve latency. If you only
+	  care about latency enable this.
+
+	  This can still be enabled runtime with the boot parameter
+	  rqshare=smp
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config RQ_ALL
+	bool "NUMA"
+	depends on SMP && SCHED_MUQSS
+	help
+	  With this option enabled, the CPU scheduler will have one runqueue
+	  regardless of the architecture configuration, including across NUMA
+	  nodes. This can substantially decrease throughput in NUMA
+	  configurations, but light NUMA designs will not be dramatically
+	  affected. This option should only be chosen if latency is the prime
+	  concern.

+  Copyright (C) 2011,2016 Con Kolivas.
+
+  Code based on example originally by William Pugh.
+
+Skip Lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees, as
+described in the June 1990 issue of CACM and were invented by
+William Pugh in 1987.
+
+A couple of comments about this implementation:
+The routine randomLevel has been hard-coded to generate random
+levels using p=0.25. It can be easily changed.
+
+The insertion routine has been implemented so as to use the
+dirty hack described in the CACM paper: if a random level is
+generated that is more than the current maximum level, the
+current maximum level plus one is used instead.
+
+Levels start at zero and go up to MaxLevel (which is equal to
+MaxNumberOfLevels-1).
+
+The routines defined in this file are:
+
+init: defines slnode
+
+new_skiplist: returns a new, empty list
+
+randomLevel: Returns a random level based on a u64 random seed passed to it.
+In MuQSS, the "niffy" time is used for this purpose.
+
+insert(l,key, value): inserts the binding (key, value) into l. This operation
+occurs in O(log n) time.
+
+delnode(slnode, l, node): deletes any binding of key from the l based on the
+actual node value. This operation occurs in O(k) time where k is the
+number of levels of the node in question (max 8). The original delete
+function occurred in O(log n) time and involved a search.
+
+MuQSS Notes: In this implementation of skiplists, there are bidirectional
+next/prev pointers and the insert function returns a pointer to the actual
+node the value is stored. The key here is chosen by the scheduler so as to
+sort tasks according to the priority list requirements and is no longer used
+by the scheduler after insertion. The scheduler lookup, however, occurs in
+O(1) time because it is always the first item in the level 0 linked list.
+Since the task struct stores a copy of the node pointer upon skiplist_insert,
+it can also remove it much faster than the original implementation with the
+aid of prev<->next pointer manipulation and no searching.
