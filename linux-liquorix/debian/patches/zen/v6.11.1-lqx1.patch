+
+
+Background
+==========
+
+BitMap Queue CPU scheduler, referred to as BMQ from here on, is an evolution
+of previous Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler(PDS),
+and inspired by Zircon scheduler. The goal of it is to keep the scheduler code
+simple, while efficiency and scalable for interactive tasks, such as desktop,
+movie playback and gaming etc.
+
+Design
+======
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+BMQ use per CPU run queue design, each CPU(logical) has it's own run queue,
+each CPU is responsible for scheduling the tasks that are putting into it's
+run queue.
+
+The run queue is a set of priority queues. Note that these queues are fifo
+queue for non-rt tasks or priority queue for rt tasks in data structure. See
+BitMap Queue below for details. BMQ is optimized for non-rt tasks in the fact
+that most applications are non-rt tasks. No matter the queue is fifo or
+priority, In each queue is an ordered list of runnable tasks awaiting execution
+and the data structures are the same. When it is time for a new task to run,
+the scheduler simply looks the lowest numbered queueue that contains a task,
+and runs the first task from the head of that queue. And per CPU idle task is
+also in the run queue, so the scheduler can always find a task to run on from
+its run queue.
+
+Each task will assigned the same timeslice(default 4ms) when it is picked to
+start running. Task will be reinserted at the end of the appropriate priority
+queue when it uses its whole timeslice. When the scheduler selects a new task
+from the priority queue it sets the CPU's preemption timer for the remainder of
+the previous timeslice. When that timer fires the scheduler will stop execution
+on that task, select another task and start over again.
+
+If a task blocks waiting for a shared resource then it's taken out of its
+priority queue and is placed in a wait queue for the shared resource. When it
+is unblocked it will be reinserted in the appropriate priority queue of an
+eligible CPU.
+
+Task policy
+-----------
+
+BMQ supports DEADLINE, FIFO, RR, NORMAL, BATCH and IDLE task policy like the
+mainline CFS scheduler. But BMQ is heavy optimized for non-rt task, that's
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE policy tasks. Below is the implementation detail of each
+policy.
+
+DEADLINE
+	It is squashed as priority 0 FIFO task.
+
+FIFO/RR
+	All RT tasks share one single priority queue in BMQ run queue designed. The
+complexity of insert operation is O(n). BMQ is not designed for system runs
+with major rt policy tasks.
+
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE
+	BATCH and IDLE tasks are treated as the same policy. They compete CPU with
+NORMAL policy tasks, but they just don't boost. To control the priority of
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE tasks, simply use nice level.
+
+ISO
+	ISO policy is not supported in BMQ. Please use nice level -20 NORMAL policy
+task instead.
+
+Priority management
+-------------------
+
+RT tasks have priority from 0-99. For non-rt tasks, there are three different
+factors used to determine the effective priority of a task. The effective
+priority being what is used to determine which queue it will be in.
+
+The first factor is simply the task’s static priority. Which is assigned from
+task's nice level, within [-20, 19] in userland's point of view and [0, 39]
+internally.
+
+The second factor is the priority boost. This is a value bounded between
+[-MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ, MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ] used to offset the base priority, it is
+modified by the following cases:
+
+*When a thread has used up its entire timeslice, always deboost its boost by
+increasing by one.
+*When a thread gives up cpu control(voluntary or non-voluntary) to reschedule,
+and its switch-in time(time after last switch and run) below the thredhold
+based on its priority boost, will boost its boost by decreasing by one buti is
+capped at 0 (won’t go negative).
+
+The intent in this system is to ensure that interactive threads are serviced
+quickly. These are usually the threads that interact directly with the user
+and cause user-perceivable latency. These threads usually do little work and
+spend most of their time blocked awaiting another user event. So they get the
+priority boost from unblocking while background threads that do most of the
+processing receive the priority penalty for using their entire timeslice.

+===================================
+NT synchronization primitive driver
+===================================
+
+This page documents the user-space API for the ntsync driver.
+
+ntsync is a support driver for emulation of NT synchronization
+primitives by user-space NT emulators. It exists because implementation
+in user-space, using existing tools, cannot match Windows performance
+while offering accurate semantics. It is implemented entirely in
+software, and does not drive any hardware device.
+
+This interface is meant as a compatibility tool only, and should not
+be used for general synchronization. Instead use generic, versatile
+interfaces such as futex(2) and poll(2).
+
+Synchronization primitives
+==========================
+
+The ntsync driver exposes three types of synchronization primitives:
+semaphores, mutexes, and events.
+
+A semaphore holds a single volatile 32-bit counter, and a static 32-bit
+integer denoting the maximum value. It is considered signaled (that is,
+can be acquired without contention, or will wake up a waiting thread)
+when the counter is nonzero. The counter is decremented by one when a
+wait is satisfied. Both the initial and maximum count are established
+when the semaphore is created.
+
+A mutex holds a volatile 32-bit recursion count, and a volatile 32-bit
+identifier denoting its owner. A mutex is considered signaled when its
+owner is zero (indicating that it is not owned). The recursion count is
+incremented when a wait is satisfied, and ownership is set to the given
+identifier.
+
+A mutex also holds an internal flag denoting whether its previous owner
+has died; such a mutex is said to be abandoned. Owner death is not
+tracked automatically based on thread death, but rather must be
+communicated using ``NTSYNC_IOC_MUTEX_KILL``. An abandoned mutex is
+inherently considered unowned.
+
+Except for the "unowned" semantics of zero, the actual value of the
+owner identifier is not interpreted by the ntsync driver at all. The
+intended use is to store a thread identifier; however, the ntsync
+driver does not actually validate that a calling thread provides
+consistent or unique identifiers.
+
+An event is similar to a semaphore with a maximum count of one. It holds
+a volatile boolean state denoting whether it is signaled or not. There
+are two types of events, auto-reset and manual-reset. An auto-reset
+event is designaled when a wait is satisfied; a manual-reset event is
+not. The event type is specified when the event is created.
+
+Unless specified otherwise, all operations on an object are atomic and
+totally ordered with respect to other operations on the same object.
+
+Objects are represented by files. When all file descriptors to an
+object are closed, that object is deleted.
+
+Char device
+===========
+
+The ntsync driver creates a single char device /dev/ntsync. Each file
+description opened on the device represents a unique instance intended
+to back an individual NT virtual machine. Objects created by one ntsync
+instance may only be used with other objects created by the same
+instance.
+
+ioctl reference
+===============
+
+All operations on the device are done through ioctls. There are four
+structures used in ioctl calls::
+
+   struct ntsync_sem_args {
+   	__u32 sem;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 max;
+   };
+
+   struct ntsync_mutex_args {
+   	__u32 mutex;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 count;
+   };
+
+   struct ntsync_event_args {
+   	__u32 event;
+   	__u32 signaled;
+   	__u32 manual;
+   };
+
+   struct ntsync_wait_args {
+   	__u64 timeout;
+   	__u64 objs;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 index;
+   	__u32 alert;
+   	__u32 flags;
+   	__u32 pad;
+   };
+
+Depending on the ioctl, members of the structure may be used as input,
+output, or not at all. All ioctls return 0 on success.
+
+The ioctls on the device file are as follows:
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_CREATE_SEM
+
+  Create a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - On output, contains a file descriptor to the created semaphore.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - Maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+  Fails with ``EINVAL`` if ``count`` is greater than ``max``.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_CREATE_MUTEX
+
+  Create a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - On output, contains a file descriptor to the created mutex.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial recursion count of the mutex.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Initial owner of the mutex.
+
+  If ``owner`` is nonzero and ``count`` is zero, or if ``owner`` is
+  zero and ``count`` is nonzero, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_CREATE_EVENT
+
+  Create an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - On output, contains a file descriptor to the created event.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - If nonzero, the event is initially signaled, otherwise
+         nonsignaled.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - If nonzero, the event is a manual-reset event, otherwise
+         auto-reset.
+
+The ioctls on the individual objects are as follows:
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_SEM_POST
+
+  Post to a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer,
+  which on input holds the count to be added to the semaphore, and on
+  output contains its previous count.
+
+  If adding to the semaphore's current count would raise the latter
+  past the semaphore's maximum count, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOVERFLOW`` and the semaphore is not affected. If raising the
+  semaphore's count causes it to become signaled, eligible threads
+  waiting on this semaphore will be woken and the semaphore's count
+  decremented appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_MUTEX_UNLOCK
+
+  Release a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Specifies the owner trying to release this mutex.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the previous recursion count.
+
+  If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with ``EINVAL``. If ``owner``
+  is not the current owner of the mutex, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EPERM``.
+
+  The mutex's count will be decremented by one. If decrementing the
+  mutex's count causes it to become zero, the mutex is marked as
+  unowned and signaled, and eligible threads waiting on it will be
+  woken as appropriate.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_SET_EVENT
+
+  Signal an event object. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer, which on
+  output contains the previous state of the event.
+
+  Eligible threads will be woken, and auto-reset events will be
+  designaled appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_RESET_EVENT
+
+  Designal an event object. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer, which
+  on output contains the previous state of the event.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_PULSE_EVENT
+
+  Wake threads waiting on an event object while leaving it in an
+  unsignaled state. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer, which on
+  output contains the previous state of the event.
+
+  A pulse operation can be thought of as a set followed by a reset,
+  performed as a single atomic operation. If two threads are waiting on
+  an auto-reset event which is pulsed, only one will be woken. If two
+  threads are waiting a manual-reset event which is pulsed, both will
+  be woken. However, in both cases, the event will be unsignaled
+  afterwards, and a simultaneous read operation will always report the
+  event as unsignaled.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_READ_SEM
+
+  Read the current state of a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to
+  struct :c:type:`ntsync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - On output, contains the maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_READ_MUTEX
+
+  Read the current state of a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - On output, contains the current owner of the mutex, or zero
+         if the mutex is not currently owned.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current recursion count of the mutex.
+
+  If the mutex is marked as abandoned, the function fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. In this case, ``count`` and ``owner`` are set to
+  zero.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_READ_EVENT
+
+  Read the current state of an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - On output, contains the current state of the event.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - On output, contains 1 if the event is a manual-reset event,
+         and 0 otherwise.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_KILL_OWNER
+
+  Mark a mutex as unowned and abandoned if it is owned by the given
+  owner. Takes an input-only pointer to a 32-bit integer denoting the
+  owner. If the owner is zero, the ioctl fails with ``EINVAL``. If the
+  owner does not own the mutex, the function fails with ``EPERM``.
+
+  Eligible threads waiting on the mutex will be woken as appropriate
+  (and such waits will fail with ``EOWNERDEAD``, as described below).
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY
+
+  Poll on any of a list of objects, atomically acquiring at most one.
+  Takes a pointer to struct :c:type:`ntsync_wait_args`, which is
+  used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``timeout``
+       - Absolute timeout in nanoseconds. If ``NTSYNC_WAIT_REALTIME``
+         is set, the timeout is measured against the REALTIME clock;
+         otherwise it is measured against the MONOTONIC clock. If the
+         timeout is equal to or earlier than the current time, the
+         function returns immediately without sleeping. If ``timeout``
+         is U64_MAX, the function will sleep until an object is
+         signaled, and will not fail with ``ETIMEDOUT``.
+     * - ``objs``
+       - Pointer to an array of ``count`` file descriptors
+         (specified as an integer so that the structure has the same
+         size regardless of architecture). If any object is
+         invalid, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Number of objects specified in the ``objs`` array.
+         If greater than ``NTSYNC_MAX_WAIT_COUNT``, the function fails
+         with ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Mutex owner identifier. If any object in ``objs`` is a mutex,
+         the ioctl will attempt to acquire that mutex on behalf of
+         ``owner``. If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with
+         ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``index``
+       - On success, contains the index (into ``objs``) of the object
+         which was signaled. If ``alert`` was signaled instead,
+         this contains ``count``.
+     * - ``alert``
+       - Optional event object file descriptor. If nonzero, this
+         specifies an "alert" event object which, if signaled, will
+         terminate the wait. If nonzero, the identifier must point to a
+         valid event.
+     * - ``flags``
+       - Zero or more flags. Currently the only flag is
+         ``NTSYNC_WAIT_REALTIME``, which causes the timeout to be
+         measured against the REALTIME clock instead of MONOTONIC.
+     * - ``pad``
+       - Unused, must be set to zero.
+
+  This function attempts to acquire one of the given objects. If unable
+  to do so, it sleeps until an object becomes signaled, subsequently
+  acquiring it, or the timeout expires. In the latter case the ioctl
+  fails with ``ETIMEDOUT``. The function only acquires one object, even
+  if multiple objects are signaled.
+
+  A semaphore is considered to be signaled if its count is nonzero, and
+  is acquired by decrementing its count by one. A mutex is considered
+  to be signaled if it is unowned or if its owner matches the ``owner``
+  argument, and is acquired by incrementing its recursion count by one
+  and setting its owner to the ``owner`` argument. An auto-reset event
+  is acquired by designaling it; a manual-reset event is not affected
+  by acquisition.
+
+  Acquisition is atomic and totally ordered with respect to other
+  operations on the same object. If two wait operations (with different
+  ``owner`` identifiers) are queued on the same mutex, only one is
+  signaled. If two wait operations are queued on the same semaphore,
+  and a value of one is posted to it, only one is signaled.
+
+  If an abandoned mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Although this is a failure return, the function may
+  otherwise be considered successful. The mutex is marked as owned by
+  the given owner (with a recursion count of 1) and as no longer
+  abandoned, and ``index`` is still set to the index of the mutex.
+
+  The ``alert`` argument is an "extra" event which can terminate the
+  wait, independently of all other objects.
+
+  It is valid to pass the same object more than once, including by
+  passing the same event in the ``objs`` array and in ``alert``. If a
+  wakeup occurs due to that object being signaled, ``index`` is set to
+  the lowest index corresponding to that object.
+
+  The function may fail with ``EINTR`` if a signal is received.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ALL
+
+  Poll on a list of objects, atomically acquiring all of them. Takes a
+  pointer to struct :c:type:`ntsync_wait_args`, which is used
+  identically to ``NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, except that ``index`` is
+  always filled with zero on success if not woken via alert.
+
+  This function attempts to simultaneously acquire all of the given
+  objects. If unable to do so, it sleeps until all objects become
+  simultaneously signaled, subsequently acquiring them, or the timeout
+  expires. In the latter case the ioctl fails with ``ETIMEDOUT`` and no
+  objects are modified.
+
+  Objects may become signaled and subsequently designaled (through
+  acquisition by other threads) while this thread is sleeping. Only
+  once all objects are simultaneously signaled does the ioctl acquire
+  them and return. The entire acquisition is atomic and totally ordered
+  with respect to other operations on any of the given objects.
+
+  If an abandoned mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Similarly to ``NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, all objects are
+  nevertheless marked as acquired. Note that if multiple mutex objects
+  are specified, there is no way to know which were marked as
+  abandoned.
+
+  As with "any" waits, the ``alert`` argument is an "extra" event which
+  can terminate the wait. Critically, however, an "all" wait will
+  succeed if all members in ``objs`` are signaled, *or* if ``alert`` is
+  signaled. In the latter case ``index`` will be set to ``count``. As
+  with "any" waits, if both conditions are filled, the former takes
+  priority, and objects in ``objs`` will be acquired.
+
+  Unlike ``NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, it is not valid to pass the same
+  object more than once, nor is it valid to pass the same object in
+  ``objs`` and in ``alert``. If this is attempted, the function fails
+  with ``EINVAL``.

+	  Specify a specific x86-64 compiler ISA level.
+
+	  There are three x86-64 ISA levels that work on top of
+	  the x86-64 baseline, namely: x86-64-v2, x86-64-v3, and x86-64-v4.
+
+	  x86-64-v2 brings support for vector instructions up to Streaming SIMD
+	  Extensions 4.2 (SSE4.2) and Supplemental Streaming SIMD Extensions 3
+	  (SSSE3), the POPCNT instruction, and CMPXCHG16B.
+
+	  x86-64-v3 adds vector instructions up to AVX2, MOVBE, and additional
+	  bit-manipulation instructions.
+
+	  x86-64-v4 is not included since the kernel does not use AVX512 instructions
+
+	  You can find the best version for your CPU by running one of the following:
+	  /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
+	  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported

+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

+ *       hrtimer_cpu_base->lock (hrtimer_start() for bandwidth controls)
+ *
+ *  rq1->lock
+ *    rq2->lock  where: rq1 < rq2
+ *
+ * Regular state:
+ *
+ * Normal scheduling state is serialized by rq->lock. __schedule() takes the
+ * local CPU's rq->lock, it optionally removes the task from the runqueue and
+ * always looks at the local rq data structures to find the most eligible task
+ * to run next.
+ *
+ * Task enqueue is also under rq->lock, possibly taken from another CPU.
+ * Wakeups from another LLC domain might use an IPI to transfer the enqueue to
+ * the local CPU to avoid bouncing the runqueue state around [ see
+ * ttwu_queue_wakelist() ]
+ *
+ * Task wakeup, specifically wakeups that involve migration, are horribly
+ * complicated to avoid having to take two rq->locks.
+ *
+ * Special state:
+ *
+ * System-calls and anything external will use task_rq_lock() which acquires
+ * both p->pi_lock and rq->lock. As a consequence the state they change is
+ * stable while holding either lock:
+ *
+ *  - sched_setaffinity()/
+ *    set_cpus_allowed_ptr():	p->cpus_ptr, p->nr_cpus_allowed
+ *  - set_user_nice():		p->se.load, p->*prio
+ *  - __sched_setscheduler():	p->sched_class, p->policy, p->*prio,
+ *				p->se.load, p->rt_priority,
+ *				p->dl.dl_{runtime, deadline, period, flags, bw, density}
+ *  - sched_setnuma():		p->numa_preferred_nid
+ *  - sched_move_task():        p->sched_task_group
+ *  - uclamp_update_active()	p->uclamp*
+ *
+ * p->state <- TASK_*:
+ *
+ *   is changed locklessly using set_current_state(), __set_current_state() or
+ *   set_special_state(), see their respective comments, or by
+ *   try_to_wake_up(). This latter uses p->pi_lock to serialize against
+ *   concurrent self.
+ *
+ * p->on_rq <- { 0, 1 = TASK_ON_RQ_QUEUED, 2 = TASK_ON_RQ_MIGRATING }:
+ *
+ *   is set by activate_task() and cleared by deactivate_task(), under
+ *   rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is runnable, the special
+ *   ON_RQ_MIGRATING state is used for migration without holding both
+ *   rq->locks. It indicates task_cpu() is not stable, see task_rq_lock().
+ *
+ * p->on_cpu <- { 0, 1 }:
+ *
+ *   is set by prepare_task() and cleared by finish_task() such that it will be
+ *   set before p is scheduled-in and cleared after p is scheduled-out, both
+ *   under rq->lock. Non-zero indicates the task is running on its CPU.
+ *
+ *   [ The astute reader will observe that it is possible for two tasks on one
+ *     CPU to have ->on_cpu = 1 at the same time. ]
+ *
+ * task_cpu(p): is changed by set_task_cpu(), the rules are:
+ *
+ *  - Don't call set_task_cpu() on a blocked task:
+ *
+ *    We don't care what CPU we're not running on, this simplifies hotplug,
+ *    the CPU assignment of blocked tasks isn't required to be valid.
+ *
+ *  - for try_to_wake_up(), called under p->pi_lock:
+ *
+ *    This allows try_to_wake_up() to only take one rq->lock, see its comment.
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under rq->lock:
+ *    [ see task_on_rq_migrating() in task_rq_lock() ]
+ *
+ *    o move_queued_task()
+ *    o detach_task()
+ *
+ *  - for migration called under double_rq_lock():
+ *
+ *    o __migrate_swap_task()
+ *    o push_rt_task() / pull_rt_task()
+ *    o push_dl_task() / pull_dl_task()

+ * Notes on Program-Order guarantees on SMP systems.
+ *
+ *  MIGRATION
+ *
+ * The basic program-order guarantee on SMP systems is that when a task [t]
+ * migrates, all its activity on its old CPU [c0] happens-before any subsequent
+ * execution on its new CPU [c1].
+ *
+ * For migration (of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
+ *
+ *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
+ *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
+ *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
+ *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
+ *
+ * Transitivity guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
+ * Note: we only require RCpc transitivity.
+ * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   sched-in Y
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(0)->lock // orders against CPU0
+ *                                   dequeue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *                                   enqueue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *                   LOCK rq(1)->lock // orders against CPU2
+ *                   sched-out Z
+ *                   sched-in X
+ *                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ *  BLOCKING -- aka. SLEEP + WAKEUP
+ *
+ * For blocking we (obviously) need to provide the same guarantee as for
+ * migration. However the means are completely different as there is no lock
+ * chain to provide order. Instead we do:
+ *
+ *   1) smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0)   -- finish_task()
+ *   2) smp_cond_load_acquire(!X->on_cpu) -- try_to_wake_up()
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0 (schedule)  CPU1 (try_to_wake_up) CPU2 (schedule)
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock LOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   dequeue X
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0);
+ *
+ *                    smp_cond_load_acquire(&X->on_cpu, !VAL);
+ *                    X->state = WAKING
+ *                    set_task_cpu(X,2)
+ *
+ *                    LOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *                    enqueue X
+ *                    X->state = RUNNING
+ *                    UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                                          LOCK rq(2)->lock // orders against CPU1
+ *                                          sched-out Z
+ *                                          sched-in X
+ *                                          UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                    UNLOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ * However; for wakeups there is a second guarantee we must provide, namely we
+ * must observe the state that lead to our wakeup. That is, not only must our
+ * task observe its own prior state, it must also observe the stores prior to
+ * its wakeup.
+ *
+ * This means that any means of doing remote wakeups must order the CPU doing
+ * the wakeup against the CPU the task is going to end up running on. This,
+ * however, is already required for the regular Program-Order guarantee above,
+ * since the waking CPU is the one issueing the ACQUIRE (smp_cond_load_acquire).

+ * This has been extended to SMP, by doing the same for each CPU. This however
+ * is broken.
+ *
+ * Imagine for instance the case where two tasks block on one CPU, only the one
+ * CPU will have IO-wait accounted, while the other has regular idle. Even
+ * though, if the storage were faster, both could've ran at the same time,
+ * utilising both CPUs.
+ *
+ * This means, that when looking globally, the current IO-wait accounting on
+ * SMP is a lower bound, by reason of under accounting.
+ *
+ * Worse, since the numbers are provided per CPU, they are sometimes
+ * interpreted per CPU, and that is nonsensical. A blocked task isn't strictly
+ * associated with any one particular CPU, it can wake to another CPU than it

+ *   2. TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is checked on interrupt and userspace return

+ * mm_cid remote-clear implements a lock-free algorithm to clear per-mm/cpu cid

+ *
+ * There is one basic properties we want to guarantee here:
+ *
+ * (1) Remote-clear should _never_ mark a per-cpu cid UNSET when it is actively
+ * used by a task. That would lead to concurrent allocation of the cid and
+ * userspace corruption.
+ *
+ * Provide this guarantee by introducing a Dekker memory ordering to guarantee
+ * that a pair of loads observe at least one of a pair of stores, which can be
+ * shown as:
+ *
+ *      X = Y = 0
+ *
+ *      w[X]=1          w[Y]=1
+ *      MB              MB
+ *      r[Y]=y          r[X]=x
+ *
+ * Which guarantees that x==0 && y==0 is impossible. But rather than using
+ * values 0 and 1, this algorithm cares about specific state transitions of the
+ * runqueue current task (as updated by the scheduler context switch), and the
+ * per-mm/cpu cid value.
+ *
+ * Let's introduce task (Y) which has task->mm == mm and task (N) which has
+ * task->mm != mm for the rest of the discussion. There are two scheduler state
+ * transitions on context switch we care about:
+ *
+ * (TSA) Store to rq->curr with transition from (N) to (Y)
+ *
+ * (TSB) Store to rq->curr with transition from (Y) to (N)
+ *
+ * On the remote-clear side, there is one transition we care about:
+ *
+ * (TMA) cmpxchg to *pcpu_cid to set the LAZY flag
+ *
+ * There is also a transition to UNSET state which can be performed from all
+ * sides (scheduler, remote-clear). It is always performed with a cmpxchg which
+ * guarantees that only a single thread will succeed:
+ *
+ * (TMB) cmpxchg to *pcpu_cid to mark UNSET
+ *
+ * Just to be clear, what we do _not_ want to happen is a transition to UNSET
+ * when a thread is actively using the cid (property (1)).
+ *
+ * Let's looks at the relevant combinations of TSA/TSB, and TMA transitions.
+ *
+ * Scenario A) (TSA)+(TMA) (from next task perspective)
+ *
+ * CPU0                                      CPU1
+ *
+ * Context switch CS-1                       Remote-clear
+ *   - store to rq->curr: (N)->(Y) (TSA)     - cmpxchg to *pcpu_id to LAZY (TMA)
+ *                                             (implied barrier after cmpxchg)
+ *   - switch_mm_cid()
+ *     - memory barrier (see switch_mm_cid()
+ *       comment explaining how this barrier
+ *       is combined with other scheduler
+ *       barriers)
+ *     - mm_cid_get (next)
+ *       - READ_ONCE(*pcpu_cid)              - rcu_dereference(src_rq->curr)
+ *
+ * This Dekker ensures that either task (Y) is observed by the
+ * rcu_dereference() or the LAZY flag is observed by READ_ONCE(), or both are
+ * observed.
+ *
+ * If task (Y) store is observed by rcu_dereference(), it means that there is
+ * still an active task on the cpu. Remote-clear will therefore not transition
+ * to UNSET, which fulfills property (1).
+ *
+ * If task (Y) is not observed, but the lazy flag is observed by READ_ONCE(),
+ * it will move its state to UNSET, which clears the percpu cid perhaps
+ * uselessly (which is not an issue for correctness). Because task (Y) is not
+ * observed, CPU1 can move ahead to set the state to UNSET. Because moving
+ * state to UNSET is done with a cmpxchg expecting that the old state has the
+ * LAZY flag set, only one thread will successfully UNSET.
+ *
+ * If both states (LAZY flag and task (Y)) are observed, the thread on CPU0
+ * will observe the LAZY flag and transition to UNSET (perhaps uselessly), and
+ * CPU1 will observe task (Y) and do nothing more, which is fine.
+ *
+ * What we are effectively preventing with this Dekker is a scenario where
+ * neither LAZY flag nor store (Y) are observed, which would fail property (1)
+ * because this would UNSET a cid which is actively used.

-/* Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR) congestion control
+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control
  *
- * BBR congestion control computes the sending rate based on the delivery
- * rate (throughput) estimated from ACKs. In a nutshell:
+ * BBR is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low queues,
+ * low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model of the
+ * network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as (if they
+ * occur) packet loss and/or shallow-threshold ECN signals. Note that although
+ * it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require either; it
+ * can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
  *
- *   On each ACK, update our model of the network path:
- *      bottleneck_bandwidth = windowed_max(delivered / elapsed, 10 round trips)
- *      min_rtt = windowed_min(rtt, 10 seconds)
- *   pacing_rate = pacing_gain * bottleneck_bandwidth
- *   cwnd = max(cwnd_gain * bottleneck_bandwidth * min_rtt, 4)
- *
- * The core algorithm does not react directly to packet losses or delays,
- * although BBR may adjust the size of next send per ACK when loss is
- * observed, or adjust the sending rate if it estimates there is a
- * traffic policer, in order to keep the drop rate reasonable.
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
  *
