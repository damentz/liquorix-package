+Multi-Gen LRU
+=============
+The multi-gen LRU is an alternative LRU implementation that optimizes
+page reclaim and improves performance under memory pressure. Page
+reclaim decides the kernel's caching policy and ability to overcommit
+memory. It directly impacts the kswapd CPU usage and RAM efficiency.
+
+Quick start
+===========
+Build the kernel with the following configurations.
+
+* ``CONFIG_LRU_GEN=y``
+* ``CONFIG_LRU_GEN_ENABLED=y``
+
+All set!
+
+Runtime options
+===============
+``/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/`` contains stable ABIs described in the
+following subsections.
+
+Kill switch
+-----------
+``enabled`` accepts different values to enable or disable the
+following components. Its default value depends on
+``CONFIG_LRU_GEN_ENABLED``. All the components should be enabled
+unless some of them have unforeseen side effects. Writing to
+``enabled`` has no effect when a component is not supported by the
+hardware, and valid values will be accepted even when the main switch
+is off.
+
+====== ===============================================================
+Values Components
+====== ===============================================================
+0x0001 The main switch for the multi-gen LRU.
+0x0002 Clearing the accessed bit in leaf page table entries in large
+       batches, when MMU sets it (e.g., on x86). This behavior can
+       theoretically worsen lock contention (mmap_lock). If it is
+       disabled, the multi-gen LRU will suffer a minor performance
+       degradation for workloads that contiguously map hot pages,
+       whose accessed bits can be otherwise cleared by fewer larger
+       batches.
+0x0004 Clearing the accessed bit in non-leaf page table entries as
+       well, when MMU sets it (e.g., on x86). This behavior was not
+       verified on x86 varieties other than Intel and AMD. If it is
+       disabled, the multi-gen LRU will suffer a negligible
+       performance degradation.
+[yYnN] Apply to all the components above.
+====== ===============================================================
+
+E.g.,
+::
+
+    echo y >/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    cat /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    0x0007
+    echo 5 >/sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    cat /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled
+    0x0005
+
+Thrashing prevention
+--------------------
+Personal computers are more sensitive to thrashing because it can
+cause janks (lags when rendering UI) and negatively impact user
+experience. The multi-gen LRU offers thrashing prevention to the
+majority of laptop and desktop users who do not have ``oomd``.
+
+Users can write ``N`` to ``min_ttl_ms`` to prevent the working set of
+``N`` milliseconds from getting evicted. The OOM killer is triggered
+if this working set cannot be kept in memory. In other words, this
+option works as an adjustable pressure relief valve, and when open, it
+terminates applications that are hopefully not being used.
+
+Based on the average human detectable lag (~100ms), ``N=1000`` usually
+eliminates intolerable janks due to thrashing. Larger values like
+``N=3000`` make janks less noticeable at the risk of premature OOM
+kills.
+
+The default value ``0`` means disabled.
+
+Experimental features
+=====================
+``/sys/kernel/debug/lru_gen`` accepts commands described in the
+following subsections. Multiple command lines are supported, so does
+concatenation with delimiters ``,`` and ``;``.
+
+``/sys/kernel/debug/lru_gen_full`` provides additional stats for
+debugging. ``CONFIG_LRU_GEN_STATS=y`` keeps historical stats from
+evicted generations in this file.
+
+Working set estimation
+----------------------
+Working set estimation measures how much memory an application needs
+in a given time interval, and it is usually done with little impact on
+the performance of the application. E.g., data centers want to
+optimize job scheduling (bin packing) to improve memory utilizations.
+When a new job comes in, the job scheduler needs to find out whether
+each server it manages can allocate a certain amount of memory for
+this new job before it can pick a candidate. To do so, the job
+scheduler needs to estimate the working sets of the existing jobs.
+
+When it is read, ``lru_gen`` returns a histogram of numbers of pages
+accessed over different time intervals for each memcg and node.
+``MAX_NR_GENS`` decides the number of bins for each histogram. The
+histograms are noncumulative.
+::
+
+    memcg  memcg_id  memcg_path
+       node  node_id
+           min_gen_nr  age_in_ms  nr_anon_pages  nr_file_pages
+           ...
+           max_gen_nr  age_in_ms  nr_anon_pages  nr_file_pages
+
+Each bin contains an estimated number of pages that have been accessed
+within ``age_in_ms``. E.g., ``min_gen_nr`` contains the coldest pages
+and ``max_gen_nr`` contains the hottest pages, since ``age_in_ms`` of
+the former is the largest and that of the latter is the smallest.
+
+Users can write ``+ memcg_id node_id max_gen_nr
+[can_swap [force_scan]]`` to ``lru_gen`` to create a new generation
+``max_gen_nr+1``. ``can_swap`` defaults to the swap setting and, if it
+is set to ``1``, it forces the scan of anon pages when swap is off,
+and vice versa. ``force_scan`` defaults to ``1`` and, if it is set to
+``0``, it employs heuristics to reduce the overhead, which is likely
+to reduce the coverage as well.
+
+A typical use case is that a job scheduler writes to ``lru_gen`` at a
+certain time interval to create new generations, and it ranks the
+servers it manages based on the sizes of their cold pages defined by
+this time interval.
+
+Proactive reclaim
+-----------------
+Proactive reclaim induces page reclaim when there is no memory
+pressure. It usually targets cold pages only. E.g., when a new job
+comes in, the job scheduler wants to proactively reclaim cold pages on
+the server it selected to improve the chance of successfully landing
+this new job.
+
+Users can write ``- memcg_id node_id min_gen_nr [swappiness
+[nr_to_reclaim]]`` to ``lru_gen`` to evict generations less than or
+equal to ``min_gen_nr``. Note that ``min_gen_nr`` should be less than
+``max_gen_nr-1`` as ``max_gen_nr`` and ``max_gen_nr-1`` are not fully
+aged and therefore cannot be evicted. ``swappiness`` overrides the
+default value in ``/proc/sys/vm/swappiness``. ``nr_to_reclaim`` limits
+the number of pages to evict.
+
+A typical use case is that a job scheduler writes to ``lru_gen``
+before it tries to land a new job on a server. If it fails to
+materialize enough cold pages because of the overestimation, it
+retries on the next server according to the ranking result obtained
+from the working set estimation step. This less forceful approach
+limits the impacts on the existing jobs.

+                         --------------------------
+
+CONTENT
+========
+
+ Background
+ Design
+   Overview
+   Task policy
+   Priority management
+   BitMap Queue
+   CPU Assignment and Migration
+
+
+Background
+==========
+
+BitMap Queue CPU scheduler, referred to as BMQ from here on, is an evolution
+of previous Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler(PDS),
+and inspired by Zircon scheduler. The goal of it is to keep the scheduler code
+simple, while efficiency and scalable for interactive tasks, such as desktop,
+movie playback and gaming etc.
+
+Design
+======
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+BMQ use per CPU run queue design, each CPU(logical) has it's own run queue,
+each CPU is responsible for scheduling the tasks that are putting into it's
+run queue.
+
+The run queue is a set of priority queues. Note that these queues are fifo
+queue for non-rt tasks or priority queue for rt tasks in data structure. See
+BitMap Queue below for details. BMQ is optimized for non-rt tasks in the fact
+that most applications are non-rt tasks. No matter the queue is fifo or
+priority, In each queue is an ordered list of runnable tasks awaiting execution
+and the data structures are the same. When it is time for a new task to run,
+the scheduler simply looks the lowest numbered queueue that contains a task,
+and runs the first task from the head of that queue. And per CPU idle task is
+also in the run queue, so the scheduler can always find a task to run on from
+its run queue.
+
+Each task will assigned the same timeslice(default 4ms) when it is picked to
+start running. Task will be reinserted at the end of the appropriate priority
+queue when it uses its whole timeslice. When the scheduler selects a new task
+from the priority queue it sets the CPU's preemption timer for the remainder of
+the previous timeslice. When that timer fires the scheduler will stop execution
+on that task, select another task and start over again.
+
+If a task blocks waiting for a shared resource then it's taken out of its
+priority queue and is placed in a wait queue for the shared resource. When it
+is unblocked it will be reinserted in the appropriate priority queue of an
+eligible CPU.
+
+Task policy
+-----------
+
+BMQ supports DEADLINE, FIFO, RR, NORMAL, BATCH and IDLE task policy like the
+mainline CFS scheduler. But BMQ is heavy optimized for non-rt task, that's
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE policy tasks. Below is the implementation detail of each
+policy.
+
+DEADLINE
+	It is squashed as priority 0 FIFO task.
+
+FIFO/RR
+	All RT tasks share one single priority queue in BMQ run queue designed. The
+complexity of insert operation is O(n). BMQ is not designed for system runs
+with major rt policy tasks.
+
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE
+	BATCH and IDLE tasks are treated as the same policy. They compete CPU with
+NORMAL policy tasks, but they just don't boost. To control the priority of
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE tasks, simply use nice level.
+
+ISO
+	ISO policy is not supported in BMQ. Please use nice level -20 NORMAL policy
+task instead.
+
+Priority management
+-------------------
+
+RT tasks have priority from 0-99. For non-rt tasks, there are three different
+factors used to determine the effective priority of a task. The effective
+priority being what is used to determine which queue it will be in.
+
+The first factor is simply the task’s static priority. Which is assigned from
+task's nice level, within [-20, 19] in userland's point of view and [0, 39]
+internally.
+
+The second factor is the priority boost. This is a value bounded between
+[-MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ, MAX_PRIORITY_ADJ] used to offset the base priority, it is
+modified by the following cases:
+
+*When a thread has used up its entire timeslice, always deboost its boost by
+increasing by one.
+*When a thread gives up cpu control(voluntary or non-voluntary) to reschedule,
+and its switch-in time(time after last switch and run) below the thredhold
+based on its priority boost, will boost its boost by decreasing by one buti is
+capped at 0 (won’t go negative).
+
+The intent in this system is to ensure that interactive threads are serviced
+quickly. These are usually the threads that interact directly with the user
+and cause user-perceivable latency. These threads usually do little work and
+spend most of their time blocked awaiting another user event. So they get the
+priority boost from unblocking while background threads that do most of the
+processing receive the priority penalty for using their entire timeslice.

+Multi-Gen LRU
+=============
+The multi-gen LRU is an alternative LRU implementation that optimizes
+page reclaim and improves performance under memory pressure. Page
+reclaim decides the kernel's caching policy and ability to overcommit
+memory. It directly impacts the kswapd CPU usage and RAM efficiency.
+
+Design overview
+===============
+Objectives
+----------
+The design objectives are:
+
+* Good representation of access recency
+* Try to profit from spatial locality
+* Fast paths to make obvious choices
+* Simple self-correcting heuristics
+
+The representation of access recency is at the core of all LRU
+implementations. In the multi-gen LRU, each generation represents a
+group of pages with similar access recency. Generations establish a
+(time-based) common frame of reference and therefore help make better
+choices, e.g., between different memcgs on a computer or different
+computers in a data center (for job scheduling).
+
+Exploiting spatial locality improves efficiency when gathering the
+accessed bit. A rmap walk targets a single page and does not try to
+profit from discovering a young PTE. A page table walk can sweep all
+the young PTEs in an address space, but the address space can be too
+sparse to make a profit. The key is to optimize both methods and use
+them in combination.
+
+Fast paths reduce code complexity and runtime overhead. Unmapped pages
+do not require TLB flushes; clean pages do not require writeback.
+These facts are only helpful when other conditions, e.g., access
+recency, are similar. With generations as a common frame of reference,
+additional factors stand out. But obvious choices might not be good
+choices; thus self-correction is necessary.
+
+The benefits of simple self-correcting heuristics are self-evident.
+Again, with generations as a common frame of reference, this becomes
+attainable. Specifically, pages in the same generation can be
+categorized based on additional factors, and a feedback loop can
+statistically compare the refault percentages across those categories
+and infer which of them are better choices.
+
+Assumptions
+-----------
+The protection of hot pages and the selection of cold pages are based
+on page access channels and patterns. There are two access channels:
+
+* Accesses through page tables
+* Accesses through file descriptors
+
+The protection of the former channel is by design stronger because:
+
+1. The uncertainty in determining the access patterns of the former
+   channel is higher due to the approximation of the accessed bit.
+2. The cost of evicting the former channel is higher due to the TLB
+   flushes required and the likelihood of encountering the dirty bit.
+3. The penalty of underprotecting the former channel is higher because
+   applications usually do not prepare themselves for major page
+   faults like they do for blocked I/O. E.g., GUI applications
+   commonly use dedicated I/O threads to avoid blocking rendering
+   threads.
+
+There are also two access patterns:
+
+* Accesses exhibiting temporal locality
+* Accesses not exhibiting temporal locality
+
+For the reasons listed above, the former channel is assumed to follow
+the former pattern unless ``VM_SEQ_READ`` or ``VM_RAND_READ`` is
+present, and the latter channel is assumed to follow the latter
+pattern unless outlying refaults have been observed.
+
+Workflow overview
+=================
+Evictable pages are divided into multiple generations for each
+``lruvec``. The youngest generation number is stored in
+``lrugen->max_seq`` for both anon and file types as they are aged on
+an equal footing. The oldest generation numbers are stored in
+``lrugen->min_seq[]`` separately for anon and file types as clean file
+pages can be evicted regardless of swap constraints. These three
+variables are monotonically increasing.
+
+Generation numbers are truncated into ``order_base_2(MAX_NR_GENS+1)``
+bits in order to fit into the gen counter in ``folio->flags``. Each
+truncated generation number is an index to ``lrugen->lists[]``. The
+sliding window technique is used to track at least ``MIN_NR_GENS`` and
+at most ``MAX_NR_GENS`` generations. The gen counter stores a value
+within ``[1, MAX_NR_GENS]`` while a page is on one of
+``lrugen->lists[]``; otherwise it stores zero.
+
+Each generation is divided into multiple tiers. A page accessed ``N``
+times through file descriptors is in tier ``order_base_2(N)``. Unlike
+generations, tiers do not have dedicated ``lrugen->lists[]``. In
+contrast to moving across generations, which requires the LRU lock,
+moving across tiers only involves atomic operations on
+``folio->flags`` and therefore has a negligible cost. A feedback loop
+modeled after the PID controller monitors refaults over all the tiers
+from anon and file types and decides which tiers from which types to
+evict or protect.
+
+There are two conceptually independent procedures: the aging and the
+eviction. They form a closed-loop system, i.e., the page reclaim.
+
+Aging
+-----
+The aging produces young generations. Given an ``lruvec``, it
+increments ``max_seq`` when ``max_seq-min_seq+1`` approaches
+``MIN_NR_GENS``. The aging promotes hot pages to the youngest
+generation when it finds them accessed through page tables; the
+demotion of cold pages happens consequently when it increments
+``max_seq``. The aging uses page table walks and rmap walks to find
+young PTEs. For the former, it iterates ``lruvec_memcg()->mm_list``
+and calls ``walk_page_range()`` with each ``mm_struct`` on this list
+to scan PTEs, and after each iteration, it increments ``max_seq``. For
+the latter, when the eviction walks the rmap and finds a young PTE,
+the aging scans the adjacent PTEs. For both, on finding a young PTE,
+the aging clears the accessed bit and updates the gen counter of the
+page mapped by this PTE to ``(max_seq%MAX_NR_GENS)+1``.
+
+Eviction
+--------
+The eviction consumes old generations. Given an ``lruvec``, it
+increments ``min_seq`` when ``lrugen->lists[]`` indexed by
+``min_seq%MAX_NR_GENS`` becomes empty. To select a type and a tier to
+evict from, it first compares ``min_seq[]`` to select the older type.
+If both types are equally old, it selects the one whose first tier has
+a lower refault percentage. The first tier contains single-use
+unmapped clean pages, which are the best bet. The eviction sorts a
+page according to its gen counter if the aging has found this page
+accessed through page tables and updated its gen counter. It also
+moves a page to the next generation, i.e., ``min_seq+1``, if this page
+was accessed multiple times through file descriptors and the feedback
+loop has detected outlying refaults from the tier this page is in. To
+this end, the feedback loop uses the first tier as the baseline, for
+the reason stated earlier.
+
+Summary
+-------
+The multi-gen LRU can be disassembled into the following parts:
+
+* Generations
+* Rmap walks
+* Page table walks
+* Bloom filters
+* PID controller
+
+The aging and the eviction form a producer-consumer model;
+specifically, the latter drives the former by the sliding window over
+generations. Within the aging, rmap walks drive page table walks by
+inserting hot densely populated page tables to the Bloom filters.
+Within the eviction, the PID controller uses refaults as the feedback
+to select types to evict and tiers to protect.

+ * Author: Daniel Drake <drake@endlessm.com>
+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

+ * use a different order in the operation. First divide by the 'cpu_scale'
+ * which would reduce big value stored in the 'cost' field, then multiply by
+ * the 'sum_util'. This would allow to handle existing platforms, which have
+ * e.g. power ~1.3 Watt at max freq, so the 'cost' value > 1mln micro-Watts.
+ * In such scenario, where there are 4 CPUs in the Perf. Domain the 'sum_util'

+ * This reordering of operations has some limitations, we lose small
+ * precision in the estimation (comparing to 64bit platform w/o reordering).
  *
- * We increase resolution only if we have enough bits to allow this increased

+ *				p->se.load, p->rt_priority,
+ *				p->dl.dl_{runtime, deadline, period, flags, bw, density}
+ *  - sched_setnuma():		p->numa_preferred_nid

+ * Notes on Program-Order guarantees on SMP systems.
+ *
+ *  MIGRATION
+ *
+ * The basic program-order guarantee on SMP systems is that when a task [t]
+ * migrates, all its activity on its old CPU [c0] happens-before any subsequent
+ * execution on its new CPU [c1].
+ *
+ * For migration (of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
+ *
+ *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
+ *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
+ *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
+ *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
+ *
+ * Transitivity guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
+ * Note: we only require RCpc transitivity.
+ * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   sched-in Y
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(0)->lock // orders against CPU0
+ *                                   dequeue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *                                   enqueue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *                   LOCK rq(1)->lock // orders against CPU2
+ *                   sched-out Z
+ *                   sched-in X
+ *                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ *  BLOCKING -- aka. SLEEP + WAKEUP
+ *
+ * For blocking we (obviously) need to provide the same guarantee as for
+ * migration. However the means are completely different as there is no lock
+ * chain to provide order. Instead we do:
+ *
+ *   1) smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0)   -- finish_task()
+ *   2) smp_cond_load_acquire(!X->on_cpu) -- try_to_wake_up()
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0 (schedule)  CPU1 (try_to_wake_up) CPU2 (schedule)
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock LOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   dequeue X
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0);
+ *
+ *                    smp_cond_load_acquire(&X->on_cpu, !VAL);
+ *                    X->state = WAKING
+ *                    set_task_cpu(X,2)
+ *
+ *                    LOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *                    enqueue X
+ *                    X->state = RUNNING
+ *                    UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                                          LOCK rq(2)->lock // orders against CPU1
+ *                                          sched-out Z
+ *                                          sched-in X
+ *                                          UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *
+ *                    UNLOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ * However; for wakeups there is a second guarantee we must provide, namely we
+ * must observe the state that lead to our wakeup. That is, not only must our
+ * task observe its own prior state, it must also observe the stores prior to
+ * its wakeup.
+ *
+ * This means that any means of doing remote wakeups must order the CPU doing
+ * the wakeup against the CPU the task is going to end up running on. This,
+ * however, is already required for the regular Program-Order guarantee above,
+ * since the waking CPU is the one issueing the ACQUIRE (smp_cond_load_acquire).

+ *
+ *   2. TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is checked on interrupt and userspace return

+ *
+ *      To drive preemption between tasks, the scheduler sets the flag in timer
+ *      interrupt handler scheduler_tick().
+ *
+ *   3. Wakeups don't really cause entry into schedule(). They add a
+ *      task to the run-queue and that's it.
+ *
+ *      Now, if the new task added to the run-queue preempts the current
+ *      task, then the wakeup sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED and schedule() gets
+ *      called on the nearest possible occasion:
+ *
+ *       - If the kernel is preemptible (CONFIG_PREEMPTION=y):
+ *
+ *         - in syscall or exception context, at the next outmost
+ *           preempt_enable(). (this might be as soon as the wake_up()'s
+ *           spin_unlock()!)

+ *         - in IRQ context, return from interrupt-handler to

+	BBR2 TCP congestion control is a model-based congestion control

+	tolerates a targeted degree of random packet loss and delay that are
+	unrelated to congestion. It can operate over LAN, WAN, cellular, wifi,
+	or cable modem links, and can use DCTCP-L4S-style ECN signals.  It can
+	coexist with flows that use loss-based congestion control, and can
+	operate with shallow buffers, deep buffers, bufferbloat, policers, or
+	AQM schemes that do not provide a delay signal. It requires pacing,

+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control, v2
+ *
+ * BBRv2 is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low
+ * queues, low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model
+ * of the network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as
+ * (if they occur) packet loss and/or DCTCP/L4S-style ECN signals.  Note that
+ * although it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require
+ * either; it can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
+ *
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
+ *
+ * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
+ *
+ *             |
+ *             V
+ *    +---> STARTUP  ----+
+ *    |        |         |

+ *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
+ *
+ * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
+ * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
+ * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
+ * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
+ * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
+ * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
+ * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
+ * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
+ * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a minimum value to re-probe
+ * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
+ * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
+ * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
+ *
+ * BBR is described in detail in:
+ *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
+ *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
+ *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
+ *
+ * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
+ *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
+ *
+ * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
+ * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
+ * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.
