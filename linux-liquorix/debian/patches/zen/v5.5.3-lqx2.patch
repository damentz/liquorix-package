+BFS - The Brain Fuck Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Brain Fuck Scheduler, referred to as BFS from here on, is to
+completely do away with the complex designs of the past for the cpu process
+scheduler and instead implement one that is very simple in basic design.
+The main focus of BFS is to achieve excellent desktop interactivity and
+responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are difficult to
+understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when tuned to
+one workload cause massive detriment to another.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+BFS is best described as a single runqueue, O(n) lookup, earliest effective
+virtual deadline first design, loosely based on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual
+deadline first) and my previous Staircase Deadline scheduler. Each component
+shall be described in order to understand the significance of, and reasoning for
+it. The codebase when the first stable version was released was approximately
+9000 lines less code than the existing mainline linux kernel scheduler (in
+2.6.31). This does not even take into account the removal of documentation and
+the cgroups code that is not used.
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+The single runqueue refers to the queued but not running processes for the
+entire system, regardless of the number of CPUs. The reason for going back to
+a single runqueue design is that once multiple runqueues are introduced,
+per-CPU or otherwise, there will be complex interactions as each runqueue will
+be responsible for the scheduling latency and fairness of the tasks only on its
+own runqueue, and to achieve fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any
+advantage in throughput of having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages.
+This is due to requiring a very complex balancing system to at best achieve some
+semblance of fairness across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency
+for tasks bound to the same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness
+and latency across CPUs, the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes
+for better scalability, is lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+A significant feature of BFS is that all accounting is done purely based on CPU
+used and nowhere is sleep time used in any way to determine entitlement or
+interactivity. Interactivity "estimators" that use some kind of sleep/run
+algorithm are doomed to fail to detect all interactive tasks, and to falsely tag
+tasks that aren't interactive as being so. The reason for this is that it is
+close to impossible to determine that when a task is sleeping, whether it is
+doing it voluntarily, as in a userspace application waiting for input in the
+form of a mouse click or otherwise, or involuntarily, because it is waiting for
+another thread, process, I/O, kernel activity or whatever. Thus, such an
+estimator will introduce corner cases, and more heuristics will be required to
+cope with those corner cases, introducing more corner cases and failed
+interactivity detection and so on. Interactivity in BFS is built into the design
+by virtue of the fact that tasks that are waking up have not used up their quota
+of CPU time, and have earlier effective deadlines, thereby making it very likely
+they will preempt any CPU bound task of equivalent nice level. See below for
+more information on the virtual deadline mechanism. Even if they do not preempt
+a running task, because the rr interval is guaranteed to have a bound upper
+limit on how long a task will wait for, it will be scheduled within a timeframe
+that will not cause visible interface jitter.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Task insertion.
+
+BFS inserts tasks into each relevant queue as an O(1) insertion into a double
+linked list. On insertion, *every* running queue is checked to see if the newly
+queued task can run on any idle queue, or preempt the lowest running task on the
+system. This is how the cross-CPU scheduling of BFS achieves significantly lower
+latency per extra CPU the system has. In this case the lookup is, in the worst
+case scenario, O(n) where n is the number of CPUs on the system.
+
+Data protection.
+
+BFS has one single lock protecting the process local data of every task in the
+global queue. Thus every insertion, removal and modification of task data in the
+global runqueue needs to grab the global lock. However, once a task is taken by
+a CPU, the CPU has its own local data copy of the running process' accounting
+information which only that CPU accesses and modifies (such as during a
+timer tick) thus allowing the accounting data to be updated lockless. Once a
+CPU has taken a task to run, it removes it from the global queue. Thus the
+global queue only ever has, at most,
+
+	(number of tasks requesting cpu time) - (number of logical CPUs) + 1
+
+tasks in the global queue. This value is relevant for the time taken to look up
+tasks during scheduling. This will increase if many tasks with CPU affinity set
+in their policy to limit which CPUs they're allowed to run on if they outnumber
+the number of CPUs. The +1 is because when rescheduling a task, the CPU's
+currently running task is put back on the queue. Lookup will be described after
+the virtual deadline mechanism is explained.
+
+Virtual deadline.
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in BFS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in BFS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in jiffies by this equation:
+
+	jiffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases. Once a task is descheduled, it is put back on the queue, and an
+O(n) lookup of all queued-but-not-running tasks is done to determine which has
+the earliest deadline and that task is chosen to receive CPU next.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (jiffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup.
+
+BFS has 103 priority queues. 100 of these are dedicated to the static priority
+of realtime tasks, and the remaining 3 are, in order of best to worst priority,
+SCHED_ISO (isochronous), SCHED_NORMAL, and SCHED_IDLEPRIO (idle priority
+scheduling). When a task of these priorities is queued, a bitmap of running
+priorities is set showing which of these priorities has tasks waiting for CPU
+time. When a CPU is made to reschedule, the lookup for the next task to get
+CPU time is performed in the following way:
+
+First the bitmap is checked to see what static priority tasks are queued. If
+any realtime priorities are found, the corresponding queue is checked and the
+first task listed there is taken (provided CPU affinity is suitable) and lookup
+is complete. If the priority corresponds to a SCHED_ISO task, they are also
+taken in FIFO order (as they behave like SCHED_RR). If the priority corresponds
+to either SCHED_NORMAL or SCHED_IDLEPRIO, then the lookup becomes O(n). At this
+stage, every task in the runlist that corresponds to that priority is checked
+to see which has the earliest set deadline, and (provided it has suitable CPU
+affinity) it is taken off the runqueue and given the CPU. If a task has an
+expired deadline, it is taken and the rest of the lookup aborted (as they are
+chosen in FIFO order).
+
+Thus, the lookup is O(n) in the worst case only, where n is as described
+earlier, as tasks may be chosen before the whole task list is looked over.
+
+
+Scalability.
+
+The major limitations of BFS will be that of scalability, as the separate
+runqueue designs will have less lock contention as the number of CPUs rises.
+However they do not scale linearly even with separate runqueues as multiple
+runqueues will need to be locked concurrently on such designs to be able to
+achieve fair CPU balancing, to try and achieve some sort of nice-level fairness
+across CPUs, and to achieve low enough latency for tasks on a busy CPU when
+other CPUs would be more suited. BFS has the advantage that it requires no
+balancing algorithm whatsoever, as balancing occurs by proxy simply because
+all CPUs draw off the global runqueue, in priority and deadline order. Despite
+the fact that scalability is _not_ the prime concern of BFS, it both shows very
+good scalability to smaller numbers of CPUs and is likely a more scalable design
+at these numbers of CPUs.
+
+It also has some very low overhead scalability features built into the design
+when it has been deemed their overhead is so marginal that they're worth adding.
+The first is the local copy of the running process' data to the CPU it's running
+on to allow that data to be updated lockless where possible. Then there is
+deference paid to the last CPU a task was running on, by trying that CPU first
+when looking for an idle CPU to use the next time it's scheduled. Finally there
+is the notion of cache locality beyond the last running CPU. The sched_domains
+information is used to determine the relative virtual "cache distance" that
+other CPUs have from the last CPU a task was running on. CPUs with shared
+caches, such as SMT siblings, or multicore CPUs with shared caches, are treated
+as cache local. CPUs without shared caches are treated as not cache local, and
+CPUs on different NUMA nodes are treated as very distant. This "relative cache
+distance" is used by modifying the virtual deadline value when doing lookups.
+Effectively, the deadline is unaltered between "cache local" CPUs, doubled for
+"cache distant" CPUs, and quadrupled for "very distant" CPUs. The reasoning
+behind the doubling of deadlines is as follows. The real cost of migrating a
+task from one CPU to another is entirely dependant on the cache footprint of
+the task, how cache intensive the task is, how long it's been running on that
+CPU to take up the bulk of its cache, how big the CPU cache is, how fast and
+how layered the CPU cache is, how fast a context switch is... and so on. In
+other words, it's close to random in the real world where we do more than just
+one sole workload. The only thing we can be sure of is that it's not free. So
+BFS uses the principle that an idle CPU is a wasted CPU and utilising idle CPUs
+is more important than cache locality, and cache locality only plays a part
+after that. Doubling the effective deadline is based on the premise that the
+"cache local" CPUs will tend to work on the same tasks up to double the number
+of cache local CPUs, and once the workload is beyond that amount, it is likely
+that none of the tasks are cache warm anywhere anyway. The quadrupling for NUMA
+is a value I pulled out of my arse.
+
+When choosing an idle CPU for a waking task, the cache locality is determined
+according to where the task last ran and then idle CPUs are ranked from best
+to worst to choose the most suitable idle CPU based on cache locality, NUMA
+node locality and hyperthread sibling business. They are chosen in the
+following preference (if idle):
+
+* Same core, idle or busy cache, idle threads
+* Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same core, busy threads.
+* Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+This shows the SMT or "hyperthread" awareness in the design as well which will
+choose a real idle core first before a logical SMT sibling which already has
+tasks on the physical CPU.
+
+Early benchmarking of BFS suggested scalability dropped off at the 16 CPU mark.
+However this benchmarking was performed on an earlier design that was far less
+scalable than the current one so it's hard to know how scalable it is in terms
+of both CPUs (due to the global runqueue) and heavily loaded machines (due to
+O(n) lookup) at this stage. Note that in terms of scalability, the number of
+_logical_ CPUs matters, not the number of _physical_ CPUs. Thus, a dual (2x)
+quad core (4X) hyperthreaded (2X) machine is effectively a 16X. Newer benchmark
+results are very promising indeed, without needing to tweak any knobs, features
+or options. Benchmark contributions are most welcome.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for BFS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are precisely 2 tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval
+and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO policies. In addition
+to this, BFS also uses sub-tick accounting. What BFS does _not_ now feature is
+support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither need to know what these
+are, nor should they need to be using them to have good desktop behaviour.
+
+rr_interval
+
+There is only one "scheduler" tunable, the round robin interval. This can be
+accessed in
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6 on a
+uniprocessor machine, and automatically set to a progressively higher value on
+multiprocessor machines. The reasoning behind increasing the value on more CPUs
+is that the effective latency is decreased by virtue of there being more CPUs on
+BFS (for reasons explained above), and increasing the value allows for less
+cache contention and more throughput. Valid values are from 1 to 1000
+Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of decreasing
+throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the cost of
+worsening latencies. The accuracy of the rr interval is limited by HZ resolution
+of the kernel configuration. Thus, the worst case latencies are usually slightly
+higher than this actual value. The default value of 6 is not an arbitrary one.
+It is based on the fact that humans can detect jitter at approximately 7ms, so
+aiming for much lower latencies is pointless under most circumstances. It is
+worth noting this fact when comparing the latency performance of BFS to other
+schedulers. Worst case latencies being higher than 7ms are far worse than
+average latencies not being in the microsecond range.
+
+Isochronous scheduling.
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of _total CPU_ available across the machine, configurable
+as a percentage in the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a
+scheduler tunable):
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of BFS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+Because some applications constantly set their policy as well as their nice
+level, there is potential for them to undo the override specified by the user
+on the command line of setting the policy to SCHED_ISO. To counter this, once
+a task has been set to SCHED_ISO policy, it needs superuser privileges to set
+it back to SCHED_NORMAL. This will ensure the task remains ISO and all child
+processes and threads will also inherit the ISO policy.
+
+Idleprio scheduling.
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start
+a video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this
+policy from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it
+detects a state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to
+suspend to ram and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. As
+per the Isochronous task management, once a task has been scheduled as IDLEPRIO,
+it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without superuser privileges. Tasks can
+be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+	schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting.
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the
+timer tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application
+which uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records
+zero CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible
+security implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task
+really does use. BFS tries to use the sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock,
+where possible, to determine real CPU usage. This is not entirely reliable, but
+is far more likely to produce accurate CPU usage data than the existing designs
+and will not show tasks as consuming no CPU usage when they actually are. Thus,
+the amount of CPU reported as being used by BFS will more accurately represent
+how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for example by the 'time'
+application), so the reported values may be quite different to other schedulers.
+Values reported as the 'load' are more prone to problems with this design, but
+per process values are closer to real usage. When comparing throughput of BFS
+to other designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms
+of total wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported
+"cpu usage".

+MuQSS - The Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+MuQSS is a per-cpu runqueue variant of the original BFS scheduler with
+one 8 level skiplist per runqueue, and fine grained locking for much more
+scalability.
+
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler, referred to as MuQSS from
+here on (pronounced mux) is to completely do away with the complex designs of
+the past for the cpu process scheduler and instead implement one that is very
+simple in basic design. The main focus of MuQSS is to achieve excellent desktop
+interactivity and responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are
+difficult to understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when
+tuned to one workload cause massive detriment to another, while still being
+scalable to many CPUs and processes.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+MuQSS is best described as per-cpu multiple runqueue, O(log n) insertion, O(1)
+lookup, earliest effective virtual deadline first tickless design, loosely based
+on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual deadline first) and my previous Staircase
+Deadline scheduler, and evolved from the single runqueue O(n) BFS scheduler.
+Each component shall be described in order to understand the significance of,
+and reasoning for it.
+
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+In BFS, the use of a single runqueue across all CPUs meant that each CPU would
+need to scan the entire runqueue looking for the process with the earliest
+deadline and schedule that next, regardless of which CPU it originally came
+from. This made BFS deterministic with respect to latency and provided
+guaranteed latencies dependent on number of processes and CPUs. The single
+runqueue, however, meant that all CPUs would compete for the single lock
+protecting it, which would lead to increasing lock contention as the number of
+CPUs rose and appeared to limit scalability of common workloads beyond 16
+logical CPUs. Additionally, the O(n) lookup of the runqueue list obviously
+increased overhead proportionate to the number of queued proecesses and led to
+cache thrashing while iterating over the linked list.
+
+MuQSS is an evolution of BFS, designed to maintain the same scheduling
+decision mechanism and be virtually deterministic without relying on the
+constrained design of the single runqueue by splitting out the single runqueue
+to be per-CPU and use skiplists instead of linked lists.
+
+The original reason for going back to a single runqueue design for BFS was that
+once multiple runqueues are introduced, per-CPU or otherwise, there will be
+complex interactions as each runqueue will be responsible for the scheduling
+latency and fairness of the tasks only on its own runqueue, and to achieve
+fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any advantage in throughput of
+having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages. This is due to requiring a
+very complex balancing system to at best achieve some semblance of fairness
+across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency for tasks bound to the
+same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness and latency across CPUs,
+the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes for better scalability, is
+lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+MuQSS works around the problems inherent in multiple runqueue designs by
+making its skip lists priority ordered and through novel use of lockless
+examination of each other runqueue it can decide if it should take the earliest
+deadline task from another runqueue for latency reasons, or for CPU balancing
+reasons. It still does not have a balancing system, choosing to allow the
+next task scheduling decision and task wakeup CPU choice to allow balancing to
+happen by virtue of its choices.
+
+As a further evolution of the design, MuQSS normally configures sharing of
+runqueues in a logical fashion for when CPU resources are shared for improved
+latency and throughput. By default it shares runqueues and locks between
+multicore siblings. Optionally it can be configured to run with sharing of
+SMT siblings only, all SMP packages or no sharing at all. Additionally it can
+be selected at boot time.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Custom skip list implementation:
+
+To avoid the overhead of building up and tearing down skip list structures,
+the variant used by MuQSS has a number of optimisations making it specific for
+its use case in the scheduler. It uses static arrays of 8 'levels' instead of
+building up and tearing down structures dynamically. This makes each runqueue
+only scale O(log N) up to 64k tasks. However as there is one runqueue per CPU
+it means that it scales O(log N) up to 64k x number of logical CPUs which is
+far beyond the realistic task limits each CPU could handle. By being 8 levels
+it also makes the array exactly one cacheline in size. Additionally, each
+skip list node is bidirectional making insertion and removal amortised O(1),
+being O(k) where k is 1-8. Uniquely, we are only ever interested in the very
+first entry in each list at all times with MuQSS, so there is never a need to
+do a search and thus look up is always O(1). In interactive mode, the queues
+will be searched beyond their first entry if the first task is not suitable
+for affinity or SMT nice reasons.
+
+Task insertion:
+
+MuQSS inserts tasks into a per CPU runqueue as an O(log N) insertion into
+a custom skip list as described above (based on the original design by William
+Pugh). Insertion is ordered in such a way that there is never a need to do a
+search by ordering tasks according to static priority primarily, and then
+virtual deadline at the time of insertion.
+
+Niffies:
+
+Niffies are a monotonic forward moving timer not unlike the "jiffies" but are
+of nanosecond resolution. Niffies are calculated per-runqueue from the high
+resolution TSC timers, and in order to maintain fairness are synchronised
+between CPUs whenever both runqueues are locked concurrently.
+
+Virtual deadline:
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in MuQSS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in MuQSS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in niffies by this equation:
+
+	niffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (niffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup:
+
+As tasks are already pre-ordered according to anticipated scheduling order in
+the skip lists, lookup for the next suitable task per-runqueue is always a
+matter of simply selecting the first task in the 0th level skip list entry.
+In order to maintain optimal latency and fairness across CPUs, MuQSS does a
+novel examination of every other runqueue in cache locality order, choosing the
+best task across all runqueues. This provides near-determinism of how long any
+task across the entire system may wait before receiving CPU time. The other
+runqueues are first examine lockless and then trylocked to minimise the
+potential lock contention if they are likely to have a suitable better task.
+Each other runqueue lock is only held for as long as it takes to examine the
+entry for suitability. In "interactive" mode, the default setting, MuQSS will
+look for the best deadline task across all CPUs, while in !interactive mode,
+it will only select a better deadline task from another CPU if it is more
+heavily laden than the current one.
+
+Lookup is therefore O(k) where k is number of CPUs.
+
+
+Latency.
+
+Through the use of virtual deadlines to govern the scheduling order of normal
+tasks, queue-to-activation latency per runqueue is guaranteed to be bound by
+the rr_interval tunable which is set to 6ms by default. This means that the
+longest a CPU bound task will wait for more CPU is proportional to the number
+of running tasks and in the common case of 0-2 running tasks per CPU, will be
+under the 7ms threshold for human perception of jitter. Additionally, as newly
+woken tasks will have an early deadline from their previous runtime, the very
+tasks that are usually latency sensitive will have the shortest interval for
+activation, usually preempting any existing CPU bound tasks.
+
+Tickless expiry:
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it is not tied to the resolution of the chosen tick
+rate in Hz, instead depending entirely on the high resolution timers where
+possible for sub-millisecond accuracy on timeouts regarless of the underlying
+tick rate. This allows MuQSS to be run with the low overhead of low Hz rates
+such as 100 by default, benefiting from the improved throughput and lower
+power usage it provides. Another advantage of this approach is that in
+combination with the Full No HZ option, which disables ticks on running task
+CPUs instead of just idle CPUs, the tick can be disabled at all times
+regardless of how many tasks are running instead of being limited to just one
+running task. Note that this option is NOT recommended for regular desktop
+users.
+
+
+Scalability and balancing.
+
+Unlike traditional approaches where balancing is a combination of CPU selection
+at task wakeup and intermittent balancing based on a vast array of rules set
+according to architecture, busyness calculations and special case management,
+MuQSS indirectly balances on the fly at task wakeup and next task selection.
+During initialisation, MuQSS creates a cache coherency ordered list of CPUs for
+each logical CPU and uses this to aid task/CPU selection when CPUs are busy.
+Additionally it selects any idle CPUs, if they are available, at any time over
+busy CPUs according to the following preference:
+
+ * Same thread, idle or busy cache, idle or busy threads
+ * Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+Mux is therefore SMT, MC and Numa aware without the need for extra
+intermittent balancing to maintain CPUs busy and make the most of cache
+coherency.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for MuQSS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are 3 optional tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval,
+interactive, and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO
+policies. In addition to this, MuQSS also uses sub-tick accounting. What MuQSS
+does _not_ now feature is support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither
+need to know what these are, nor should they need to be using them to have good
+desktop behaviour. However since some applications refuse to work without
+cgroups, one can enable them with MuQSS as a stub and the filesystem will be
+created which will allow the applications to work.
+
+rr_interval:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6. Valid values
+are from 1 to 1000 Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of
+decreasing throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the
+cost of worsening latencies. It is based on the fact that humans can detect
+jitter at approximately 7ms, so aiming for much lower latencies is pointless
+under most circumstances. It is worth noting this fact when comparing the
+latency performance of MuQSS to other schedulers. Worst case latencies being
+higher than 7ms are far worse than average latencies not being in the
+microsecond range.
+
+interactive:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/interactive
+
+The value is a simple boolean of 1 for on and 0 for off and is set to on by
+default. Disabling this will disable the near-determinism of MuQSS when
+selecting the next task by not examining all CPUs for the earliest deadline
+task, or which CPU to wake to, instead prioritising CPU balancing for improved
+throughput. Latency will still be bound by rr_interval, but on a per-CPU basis
+instead of across the whole system.
+
+Runqueue sharing.
+
+By default MuQSS chooses to share runqueue resources (specifically the skip
+list and locking) between multicore siblings. It is configurable at build time
+to select between None, SMT, MC and SMP, corresponding to no sharing, sharing
+only between simultaneous mulithreading siblings, multicore siblings, or
+symmetric multiprocessing physical packages. Additionally it can be se at
+bootime with the use of the rqshare parameter. The reason for configurability
+is that some architectures have CPUs with many multicore siblings (>= 16)
+where it may be detrimental to throughput to share runqueues and another
+sharing option may be desirable. Additionally, more sharing than usual can
+improve latency on a system-wide level at the expense of throughput if desired.
+
+The options are:
+none, smt, mc, smp
+
+eg:
+	rqshare=mc
+
+Isochronous scheduling:
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of CPU available per CPU, configurable as a percentage in
+the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a scheduler tunable):
+
+iso_cpu:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+
+
+Idleprio scheduling:
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start a
+video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this policy
+from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it detects a
+state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to suspend to ram
+and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. Once a task has
+been scheduled as IDLEPRIO, it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without
+superuser privileges since it is effectively a lower scheduling policy. Tasks
+can be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting:
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the timer
+tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application which
+uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records zero
+CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible security
+implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task really does
+use. Mux uses sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock to determine real CPU
+usage. Thus, the amount of CPU reported as being used by MuQSS will more
+accurately represent how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for
+example by the 'time' application), so the reported values may be quite
+different to other schedulers. When comparing throughput of MuQSS to other
+designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms of total
+wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported "cpu usage".
+
+Symmetric MultiThreading (SMT) aware nice:
+
+SMT, a.k.a. hyperthreading, is a very common feature on modern CPUs. While the
+logical CPU count rises by adding thread units to each CPU core, allowing more
+than one task to be run simultaneously on the same core, the disadvantage of it
+is that the CPU power is shared between the tasks, not summating to the power
+of two CPUs. The practical upshot of this is that two tasks running on
+separate threads of the same core run significantly slower than if they had one
+core each to run on. While smart CPU selection allows each task to have a core
+to itself whenever available (as is done on MuQSS), it cannot offset the
+slowdown that occurs when the cores are all loaded and only a thread is left.
+Most of the time this is harmless as the CPU is effectively overloaded at this
+point and the extra thread is of benefit. However when running a niced task in
+the presence of an un-niced task (say nice 19 v nice 0), the nice task gets
+precisely the same amount of CPU power as the unniced one. MuQSS has an
+optional configuration feature known as SMT-NICE which selectively idles the
+secondary niced thread for a period proportional to the nice difference,
+allowing CPU distribution according to nice level to be maintained, at the
+expense of a small amount of extra overhead. If this is configured in on a
+machine without SMT threads, the overhead is minimal.

-A laundry list of things that need looking at, most of which will
-require more work than the average checkpatch cleanup...
-
-Note that some of these entries may not be bugs - they're things
-that need to be looked at, and *possibly* fixed.
-
-Clean up the ffsCamelCase function names.
-
-Fix (thing)->flags to not use magic numbers - multiple offenders
-
-Sort out all the s32/u32/u8 nonsense - most of these should be plain int.
-
-exfat_core.c - ffsReadFile - the goto err_out seem to leak a brelse().
-same for ffsWriteFile.
-
-All the calls to fs_sync() need to be looked at, particularly in the
-context of EXFAT_DELAYED_SYNC. Currently, if that's defined, we only
-flush to disk when sync() gets called.  We should be doing at least
-metadata flushes at appropriate times.
-
-ffsTruncateFile -  if (old_size <= new_size) {
-That doesn't look right. How did it ever work? Are they relying on lazy
-block allocation when actual writes happen? If nothing else, it never
-does the 'fid->size = new_size' and do the inode update....
-
-ffsSetAttr() is just dangling in the breeze, not wired up at all...
-
-Convert global mutexes to a per-superblock mutex.
-
-Right now, we load exactly one UTF-8 table. Check to see
-if that plays nice with different codepage and iocharset values
-for simultanous mounts of different devices
-
-exfat_rmdir() checks for -EBUSY but ffsRemoveDir() doesn't return it.
-In fact, there's a complete lack of -EBUSY testing anywhere.
-
-There's probably a few missing checks for -EEXIST
-
-check return codes of sync_dirty_buffer()
-
-Why is remove_file doing a num_entries++??
-
-Double check a lot of can't-happen parameter checks (for null pointers for
-things that have only one call site and can't pass a null, etc).
-
-All the DEBUG stuff can probably be tossed, including the ioctl(). Either
-that, or convert to a proper fault-injection system.
-
-exfat_remount does exactly one thing.  Fix to actually deal with remount
-options, particularly handling R/O correctly.  For that matter, allow
-R/O mounts in the first place.
-
-Figure out why the VFAT code used multi_sector_(read|write) but the
-exfat code doesn't use it. The difference matters on SSDs with wear leveling.
-
-exfat_fat_sync(), exfat_buf_sync(), and sync_alloc_bitmap()
-aren't called anyplace....
-
-Create helper function for exfat_set_entry_time() and exfat_set_entry_type()
-because it's sort of ugly to be calling the same functionn directly and
-other code calling through the fs_func struc ponters...
-
-clean up the remaining vol_type checks, which are of two types:
-some are ?: operators with magic numbers, and the rest are places
-where we're doing stuff with '.' and '..'.
-
-Patches to:

+ * Imagine for instance the case where two tasks block on one CPU, only the one
+ * CPU will have IO-wait accounted, while the other has regular idle. Even
+ * though, if the storage were faster, both could've ran at the same time,
+ * utilising both CPUs.
+ *
+ * This means, that when looking globally, the current IO-wait accounting on
+ * SMP is a lower bound, by reason of under accounting.
+ *
+ * Worse, since the numbers are provided per CPU, they are sometimes

+  Copyright (C) 2011,2016 Con Kolivas.
+
+  Code based on example originally by William Pugh.
+
+Skip Lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees, as
+described in the June 1990 issue of CACM and were invented by
+William Pugh in 1987.
+
+A couple of comments about this implementation:
+The routine randomLevel has been hard-coded to generate random
+levels using p=0.25. It can be easily changed.
+
+The insertion routine has been implemented so as to use the
+dirty hack described in the CACM paper: if a random level is
+generated that is more than the current maximum level, the
+current maximum level plus one is used instead.
+
+Levels start at zero and go up to MaxLevel (which is equal to
+MaxNumberOfLevels-1).
+
+The routines defined in this file are:
+
+init: defines slnode
+
+new_skiplist: returns a new, empty list
+
+randomLevel: Returns a random level based on a u64 random seed passed to it.
+In MuQSS, the "niffy" time is used for this purpose.
+
+insert(l,key, value): inserts the binding (key, value) into l. This operation
+occurs in O(log n) time.
+
+delnode(slnode, l, node): deletes any binding of key from the l based on the
+actual node value. This operation occurs in O(k) time where k is the
+number of levels of the node in question (max 8). The original delete
+function occurred in O(log n) time and involved a search.
+
+MuQSS Notes: In this implementation of skiplists, there are bidirectional
+next/prev pointers and the insert function returns a pointer to the actual
+node the value is stored. The key here is chosen by the scheduler so as to
+sort tasks according to the priority list requirements and is no longer used
+by the scheduler after insertion. The scheduler lookup, however, occurs in
+O(1) time because it is always the first item in the level 0 linked list.
+Since the task struct stores a copy of the node pointer upon skiplist_insert,
+it can also remove it much faster than the original implementation with the
+aid of prev<->next pointer manipulation and no searching.
