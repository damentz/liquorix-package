+L1TF - L1 Terminal Fault
+========================
+
+L1 Terminal Fault is a hardware vulnerability which allows unprivileged
+speculative access to data which is available in the Level 1 Data Cache
+when the page table entry controlling the virtual address, which is used
+for the access, has the Present bit cleared or other reserved bits set.
+
+Affected processors
+-------------------
+
+This vulnerability affects a wide range of Intel processors. The
+vulnerability is not present on:
+
+   - Processors from AMD, Centaur and other non Intel vendors
+
+   - Older processor models, where the CPU family is < 6
+
+   - A range of Intel ATOM processors (Cedarview, Cloverview, Lincroft,
+     Penwell, Pineview, Silvermont, Airmont, Merrifield)
+
+   - The Intel XEON PHI family
+
+   - Intel processors which have the ARCH_CAP_RDCL_NO bit set in the
+     IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR. If the bit is set the CPU is not affected
+     by the Meltdown vulnerability either. These CPUs should become
+     available by end of 2018.
+
+Whether a processor is affected or not can be read out from the L1TF
+vulnerability file in sysfs. See :ref:`l1tf_sys_info`.
+
+Related CVEs
+------------
+
+The following CVE entries are related to the L1TF vulnerability:
+
+   =============  =================  ==============================
+   CVE-2018-3615  L1 Terminal Fault  SGX related aspects
+   CVE-2018-3620  L1 Terminal Fault  OS, SMM related aspects
+   CVE-2018-3646  L1 Terminal Fault  Virtualization related aspects
+   =============  =================  ==============================
+
+Problem
+-------
+
+If an instruction accesses a virtual address for which the relevant page
+table entry (PTE) has the Present bit cleared or other reserved bits set,
+then speculative execution ignores the invalid PTE and loads the referenced
+data if it is present in the Level 1 Data Cache, as if the page referenced
+by the address bits in the PTE was still present and accessible.
+
+While this is a purely speculative mechanism and the instruction will raise
+a page fault when it is retired eventually, the pure act of loading the
+data and making it available to other speculative instructions opens up the
+opportunity for side channel attacks to unprivileged malicious code,
+similar to the Meltdown attack.
+
+While Meltdown breaks the user space to kernel space protection, L1TF
+allows to attack any physical memory address in the system and the attack
+works across all protection domains. It allows an attack of SGX and also
+works from inside virtual machines because the speculation bypasses the
+extended page table (EPT) protection mechanism.
+
+
+Attack scenarios
+----------------
+
+1. Malicious user space
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   Operating Systems store arbitrary information in the address bits of a
+   PTE which is marked non present. This allows a malicious user space
+   application to attack the physical memory to which these PTEs resolve.
+   In some cases user-space can maliciously influence the information
+   encoded in the address bits of the PTE, thus making attacks more
+   deterministic and more practical.
+
+   The Linux kernel contains a mitigation for this attack vector, PTE
+   inversion, which is permanently enabled and has no performance
+   impact. The kernel ensures that the address bits of PTEs, which are not
+   marked present, never point to cacheable physical memory space.
+
+   A system with an up to date kernel is protected against attacks from
+   malicious user space applications.
+
+2. Malicious guest in a virtual machine
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   The fact that L1TF breaks all domain protections allows malicious guest
+   OSes, which can control the PTEs directly, and malicious guest user
+   space applications, which run on an unprotected guest kernel lacking the
+   PTE inversion mitigation for L1TF, to attack physical host memory.
+
+   A special aspect of L1TF in the context of virtualization is symmetric
+   multi threading (SMT). The Intel implementation of SMT is called
+   HyperThreading. The fact that Hyperthreads on the affected processors
+   share the L1 Data Cache (L1D) is important for this. As the flaw allows
+   only to attack data which is present in L1D, a malicious guest running
+   on one Hyperthread can attack the data which is brought into the L1D by
+   the context which runs on the sibling Hyperthread of the same physical
+   core. This context can be host OS, host user space or a different guest.
+
+   If the processor does not support Extended Page Tables, the attack is
+   only possible, when the hypervisor does not sanitize the content of the
+   effective (shadow) page tables.
+
+   While solutions exist to mitigate these attack vectors fully, these
+   mitigations are not enabled by default in the Linux kernel because they
+   can affect performance significantly. The kernel provides several
+   mechanisms which can be utilized to address the problem depending on the
+   deployment scenario. The mitigations, their protection scope and impact
+   are described in the next sections.
+
+   The default mitigations and the rationale for choosing them are explained
+   at the end of this document. See :ref:`default_mitigations`.
+
+.. _l1tf_sys_info:
+
+L1TF system information
+-----------------------
+
+The Linux kernel provides a sysfs interface to enumerate the current L1TF
+status of the system: whether the system is vulnerable, and which
+mitigations are active. The relevant sysfs file is:
+
+/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+  ===========================   ===============================
+  'Not affected'		The processor is not vulnerable
+  'Mitigation: PTE Inversion'	The host protection is active
+  ===========================   ===============================
+
+If KVM/VMX is enabled and the processor is vulnerable then the following
+information is appended to the 'Mitigation: PTE Inversion' part:
+
+  - SMT status:
+
+    =====================  ================
+    'VMX: SMT vulnerable'  SMT is enabled
+    'VMX: SMT disabled'    SMT is disabled
+    =====================  ================
+
+  - L1D Flush mode:
+
+    ================================  ====================================
+    'L1D vulnerable'		      L1D flushing is disabled
+
+    'L1D conditional cache flushes'   L1D flush is conditionally enabled
+
+    'L1D cache flushes'		      L1D flush is unconditionally enabled
+    ================================  ====================================
+
+The resulting grade of protection is discussed in the following sections.
+
+
+Host mitigation mechanism
+-------------------------
+
+The kernel is unconditionally protected against L1TF attacks from malicious
+user space running on the host.
+
+
+Guest mitigation mechanisms
+---------------------------
+
+.. _l1d_flush:
+
+1. L1D flush on VMENTER
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   To make sure that a guest cannot attack data which is present in the L1D
+   the hypervisor flushes the L1D before entering the guest.
+
+   Flushing the L1D evicts not only the data which should not be accessed
+   by a potentially malicious guest, it also flushes the guest
+   data. Flushing the L1D has a performance impact as the processor has to
+   bring the flushed guest data back into the L1D. Depending on the
+   frequency of VMEXIT/VMENTER and the type of computations in the guest
+   performance degradation in the range of 1% to 50% has been observed. For
+   scenarios where guest VMEXIT/VMENTER are rare the performance impact is
+   minimal. Virtio and mechanisms like posted interrupts are designed to
+   confine the VMEXITs to a bare minimum, but specific configurations and
+   application scenarios might still suffer from a high VMEXIT rate.
+
+   The kernel provides two L1D flush modes:
+    - conditional ('cond')
+    - unconditional ('always')
+
+   The conditional mode avoids L1D flushing after VMEXITs which execute
+   only audited code paths before the corresponding VMENTER. These code
+   paths have been verified that they cannot expose secrets or other
+   interesting data to an attacker, but they can leak information about the
+   address space layout of the hypervisor.
+
+   Unconditional mode flushes L1D on all VMENTER invocations and provides
+   maximum protection. It has a higher overhead than the conditional
+   mode. The overhead cannot be quantified correctly as it depends on the
+   workload scenario and the resulting number of VMEXITs.
+
+   The general recommendation is to enable L1D flush on VMENTER. The kernel
+   defaults to conditional mode on affected processors.
+
+   **Note**, that L1D flush does not prevent the SMT problem because the
+   sibling thread will also bring back its data into the L1D which makes it
+   attackable again.
+
+   L1D flush can be controlled by the administrator via the kernel command
+   line and sysfs control files. See :ref:`mitigation_control_command_line`
+   and :ref:`mitigation_control_kvm`.
+
+.. _guest_confinement:
+
+2. Guest VCPU confinement to dedicated physical cores
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   To address the SMT problem, it is possible to make a guest or a group of
+   guests affine to one or more physical cores. The proper mechanism for
+   that is to utilize exclusive cpusets to ensure that no other guest or
+   host tasks can run on these cores.
+
+   If only a single guest or related guests run on sibling SMT threads on
+   the same physical core then they can only attack their own memory and
+   restricted parts of the host memory.
+
+   Host memory is attackable, when one of the sibling SMT threads runs in
+   host OS (hypervisor) context and the other in guest context. The amount
+   of valuable information from the host OS context depends on the context
+   which the host OS executes, i.e. interrupts, soft interrupts and kernel
+   threads. The amount of valuable data from these contexts cannot be
+   declared as non-interesting for an attacker without deep inspection of
+   the code.
+
+   **Note**, that assigning guests to a fixed set of physical cores affects
+   the ability of the scheduler to do load balancing and might have
+   negative effects on CPU utilization depending on the hosting
+   scenario. Disabling SMT might be a viable alternative for particular
+   scenarios.
+
+   For further information about confining guests to a single or to a group
+   of cores consult the cpusets documentation:
+
+   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cpusets.txt
+
+.. _interrupt_isolation:
+
+3. Interrupt affinity
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   Interrupts can be made affine to logical CPUs. This is not universally
+   true because there are types of interrupts which are truly per CPU
+   interrupts, e.g. the local timer interrupt. Aside of that multi queue
+   devices affine their interrupts to single CPUs or groups of CPUs per
+   queue without allowing the administrator to control the affinities.
+
+   Moving the interrupts, which can be affinity controlled, away from CPUs
+   which run untrusted guests, reduces the attack vector space.
+
+   Whether the interrupts with are affine to CPUs, which run untrusted
+   guests, provide interesting data for an attacker depends on the system
+   configuration and the scenarios which run on the system. While for some
+   of the interrupts it can be assumed that they won't expose interesting
+   information beyond exposing hints about the host OS memory layout, there
+   is no way to make general assumptions.
+
+   Interrupt affinity can be controlled by the administrator via the
+   /proc/irq/$NR/smp_affinity[_list] files. Limited documentation is
+   available at:
+
+   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/IRQ-affinity.txt
+
+.. _smt_control:
+
+4. SMT control
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   To prevent the SMT issues of L1TF it might be necessary to disable SMT
+   completely. Disabling SMT can have a significant performance impact, but
+   the impact depends on the hosting scenario and the type of workloads.
+   The impact of disabling SMT needs also to be weighted against the impact
+   of other mitigation solutions like confining guests to dedicated cores.
+
+   The kernel provides a sysfs interface to retrieve the status of SMT and
+   to control it. It also provides a kernel command line interface to
+   control SMT.
+
+   The kernel command line interface consists of the following options:
+
+     =========== ==========================================================
+     nosmt	 Affects the bring up of the secondary CPUs during boot. The
+		 kernel tries to bring all present CPUs online during the
+		 boot process. "nosmt" makes sure that from each physical
+		 core only one - the so called primary (hyper) thread is
+		 activated. Due to a design flaw of Intel processors related
+		 to Machine Check Exceptions the non primary siblings have
+		 to be brought up at least partially and are then shut down
+		 again.  "nosmt" can be undone via the sysfs interface.
+
+     nosmt=force Has the same effect as "nosmt" but it does not allow to
+		 undo the SMT disable via the sysfs interface.
+     =========== ==========================================================
+
+   The sysfs interface provides two files:
+
+   - /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control
+   - /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active
+
+   /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control:
+
+     This file allows to read out the SMT control state and provides the
+     ability to disable or (re)enable SMT. The possible states are:
+
+	==============  ===================================================
+	on		SMT is supported by the CPU and enabled. All
+			logical CPUs can be onlined and offlined without
+			restrictions.
+
+	off		SMT is supported by the CPU and disabled. Only
+			the so called primary SMT threads can be onlined
+			and offlined without restrictions. An attempt to
+			online a non-primary sibling is rejected
+
+	forceoff	Same as 'off' but the state cannot be controlled.
+			Attempts to write to the control file are rejected.
+
+	notsupported	The processor does not support SMT. It's therefore
+			not affected by the SMT implications of L1TF.
+			Attempts to write to the control file are rejected.
+	==============  ===================================================
+
+     The possible states which can be written into this file to control SMT
+     state are:
+
+     - on
+     - off
+     - forceoff
+
+   /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active:
+
+     This file reports whether SMT is enabled and active, i.e. if on any
+     physical core two or more sibling threads are online.
+
+   SMT control is also possible at boot time via the l1tf kernel command
+   line parameter in combination with L1D flush control. See
+   :ref:`mitigation_control_command_line`.
+
+5. Disabling EPT
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+  Disabling EPT for virtual machines provides full mitigation for L1TF even
+  with SMT enabled, because the effective page tables for guests are
+  managed and sanitized by the hypervisor. Though disabling EPT has a
+  significant performance impact especially when the Meltdown mitigation
+  KPTI is enabled.
+
+  EPT can be disabled in the hypervisor via the 'kvm-intel.ept' parameter.
+
+There is ongoing research and development for new mitigation mechanisms to
+address the performance impact of disabling SMT or EPT.
+
+.. _mitigation_control_command_line:
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line
+---------------------------------------------
+
+The kernel command line allows to control the L1TF mitigations at boot
+time with the option "l1tf=". The valid arguments for this option are:
+
+  ============  =============================================================
+  full		Provides all available mitigations for the L1TF
+		vulnerability. Disables SMT and enables all mitigations in
+		the hypervisors, i.e. unconditional L1D flushing
+
+		SMT control and L1D flush control via the sysfs interface
+		is still possible after boot.  Hypervisors will issue a
+		warning when the first VM is started in a potentially
+		insecure configuration, i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush
+		disabled.
+
+  full,force	Same as 'full', but disables SMT and L1D flush runtime
+		control. Implies the 'nosmt=force' command line option.
+		(i.e. sysfs control of SMT is disabled.)
+
+  flush		Leaves SMT enabled and enables the default hypervisor
+		mitigation, i.e. conditional L1D flushing
+
+		SMT control and L1D flush control via the sysfs interface
+		is still possible after boot.  Hypervisors will issue a
+		warning when the first VM is started in a potentially
+		insecure configuration, i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush
+		disabled.
+
+  flush,nosmt	Disables SMT and enables the default hypervisor mitigation,
+		i.e. conditional L1D flushing.
+
+		SMT control and L1D flush control via the sysfs interface
+		is still possible after boot.  Hypervisors will issue a
+		warning when the first VM is started in a potentially
+		insecure configuration, i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush
+		disabled.
+
+  flush,nowarn	Same as 'flush', but hypervisors will not warn when a VM is
+		started in a potentially insecure configuration.
+
+  off		Disables hypervisor mitigations and doesn't emit any
+		warnings.
+  ============  =============================================================
+
+The default is 'flush'. For details about L1D flushing see :ref:`l1d_flush`.
+
+
+.. _mitigation_control_kvm:
+
+Mitigation control for KVM - module parameter
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The KVM hypervisor mitigation mechanism, flushing the L1D cache when
+entering a guest, can be controlled with a module parameter.
+
+The option/parameter is "kvm-intel.vmentry_l1d_flush=". It takes the
+following arguments:
+
+  ============  ==============================================================
+  always	L1D cache flush on every VMENTER.
+
+  cond		Flush L1D on VMENTER only when the code between VMEXIT and
+		VMENTER can leak host memory which is considered
+		interesting for an attacker. This still can leak host memory
+		which allows e.g. to determine the hosts address space layout.
+
+  never		Disables the mitigation
+  ============  ==============================================================
+
+The parameter can be provided on the kernel command line, as a module
+parameter when loading the modules and at runtime modified via the sysfs
+file:
+
+/sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/vmentry_l1d_flush
+
+The default is 'cond'. If 'l1tf=full,force' is given on the kernel command
+line, then 'always' is enforced and the kvm-intel.vmentry_l1d_flush
+module parameter is ignored and writes to the sysfs file are rejected.
+
+
+Mitigation selection guide
+--------------------------
+
+1. No virtualization in use
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   The system is protected by the kernel unconditionally and no further
+   action is required.
+
+2. Virtualization with trusted guests
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   If the guest comes from a trusted source and the guest OS kernel is
+   guaranteed to have the L1TF mitigations in place the system is fully
+   protected against L1TF and no further action is required.
+
+   To avoid the overhead of the default L1D flushing on VMENTER the
+   administrator can disable the flushing via the kernel command line and
+   sysfs control files. See :ref:`mitigation_control_command_line` and
+   :ref:`mitigation_control_kvm`.
+
+
+3. Virtualization with untrusted guests
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+3.1. SMT not supported or disabled
+""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+  If SMT is not supported by the processor or disabled in the BIOS or by
+  the kernel, it's only required to enforce L1D flushing on VMENTER.
+
+  Conditional L1D flushing is the default behaviour and can be tuned. See
+  :ref:`mitigation_control_command_line` and :ref:`mitigation_control_kvm`.
+
+3.2. EPT not supported or disabled
+""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+  If EPT is not supported by the processor or disabled in the hypervisor,
+  the system is fully protected. SMT can stay enabled and L1D flushing on
+  VMENTER is not required.
+
+  EPT can be disabled in the hypervisor via the 'kvm-intel.ept' parameter.
+
+3.3. SMT and EPT supported and active
+"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+  If SMT and EPT are supported and active then various degrees of
+  mitigations can be employed:
+
+  - L1D flushing on VMENTER:
+
+    L1D flushing on VMENTER is the minimal protection requirement, but it
+    is only potent in combination with other mitigation methods.
+
+    Conditional L1D flushing is the default behaviour and can be tuned. See
+    :ref:`mitigation_control_command_line` and :ref:`mitigation_control_kvm`.
+
+  - Guest confinement:
+
+    Confinement of guests to a single or a group of physical cores which
+    are not running any other processes, can reduce the attack surface
+    significantly, but interrupts, soft interrupts and kernel threads can
+    still expose valuable data to a potential attacker. See
+    :ref:`guest_confinement`.
+
+  - Interrupt isolation:
+
+    Isolating the guest CPUs from interrupts can reduce the attack surface
+    further, but still allows a malicious guest to explore a limited amount
+    of host physical memory. This can at least be used to gain knowledge
+    about the host address space layout. The interrupts which have a fixed
+    affinity to the CPUs which run the untrusted guests can depending on
+    the scenario still trigger soft interrupts and schedule kernel threads
+    which might expose valuable information. See
+    :ref:`interrupt_isolation`.
+
+The above three mitigation methods combined can provide protection to a
+certain degree, but the risk of the remaining attack surface has to be
+carefully analyzed. For full protection the following methods are
+available:
+
+  - Disabling SMT:
+
+    Disabling SMT and enforcing the L1D flushing provides the maximum
+    amount of protection. This mitigation is not depending on any of the
+    above mitigation methods.
+
+    SMT control and L1D flushing can be tuned by the command line
+    parameters 'nosmt', 'l1tf', 'kvm-intel.vmentry_l1d_flush' and at run
+    time with the matching sysfs control files. See :ref:`smt_control`,
+    :ref:`mitigation_control_command_line` and
+    :ref:`mitigation_control_kvm`.
+
+  - Disabling EPT:
+
+    Disabling EPT provides the maximum amount of protection as well. It is
+    not depending on any of the above mitigation methods. SMT can stay
+    enabled and L1D flushing is not required, but the performance impact is
+    significant.
+
+    EPT can be disabled in the hypervisor via the 'kvm-intel.ept'
+    parameter.
+
+3.4. Nested virtual machines
+""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+When nested virtualization is in use, three operating systems are involved:
+the bare metal hypervisor, the nested hypervisor and the nested virtual
+machine.  VMENTER operations from the nested hypervisor into the nested
+guest will always be processed by the bare metal hypervisor. If KVM is the
+bare metal hypervisor it wiil:
+
+ - Flush the L1D cache on every switch from the nested hypervisor to the
+   nested virtual machine, so that the nested hypervisor's secrets are not
+   exposed to the nested virtual machine;
+
+ - Flush the L1D cache on every switch from the nested virtual machine to
+   the nested hypervisor; this is a complex operation, and flushing the L1D
+   cache avoids that the bare metal hypervisor's secrets are exposed to the
+   nested virtual machine;
+
+ - Instruct the nested hypervisor to not perform any L1D cache flush. This
+   is an optimization to avoid double L1D flushing.
+
+
+.. _default_mitigations:
+
+Default mitigations
+-------------------
+
+  The kernel default mitigations for vulnerable processors are:
+
+  - PTE inversion to protect against malicious user space. This is done
+    unconditionally and cannot be controlled.
+
+  - L1D conditional flushing on VMENTER when EPT is enabled for
+    a guest.
+
+  The kernel does not by default enforce the disabling of SMT, which leaves
+  SMT systems vulnerable when running untrusted guests with EPT enabled.
+
+  The rationale for this choice is:
+
+  - Force disabling SMT can break existing setups, especially with
+    unattended updates.
+
+  - If regular users run untrusted guests on their machine, then L1TF is
+    just an add on to other malware which might be embedded in an untrusted
+    guest, e.g. spam-bots or attacks on the local network.
+
+    There is no technical way to prevent a user from running untrusted code
+    on their machines blindly.
+
+  - It's technically extremely unlikely and from today's knowledge even
+    impossible that L1TF can be exploited via the most popular attack
+    mechanisms like JavaScript because these mechanisms have no way to
+    control PTEs. If this would be possible and not other mitigation would
+    be possible, then the default might be different.
+
+  - The administrators of cloud and hosting setups have to carefully
+    analyze the risk for their scenarios and make the appropriate
+    mitigation choices, which might even vary across their deployed
+    machines and also result in other changes of their overall setup.
+    There is no way for the kernel to provide a sensible default for this
+    kind of scenarios.

+BFS - The Brain Fuck Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Brain Fuck Scheduler, referred to as BFS from here on, is to
+completely do away with the complex designs of the past for the cpu process
+scheduler and instead implement one that is very simple in basic design.
+The main focus of BFS is to achieve excellent desktop interactivity and
+responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are difficult to
+understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when tuned to
+one workload cause massive detriment to another.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+BFS is best described as a single runqueue, O(n) lookup, earliest effective
+virtual deadline first design, loosely based on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual
+deadline first) and my previous Staircase Deadline scheduler. Each component
+shall be described in order to understand the significance of, and reasoning for
+it. The codebase when the first stable version was released was approximately
+9000 lines less code than the existing mainline linux kernel scheduler (in
+2.6.31). This does not even take into account the removal of documentation and
+the cgroups code that is not used.
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+The single runqueue refers to the queued but not running processes for the
+entire system, regardless of the number of CPUs. The reason for going back to
+a single runqueue design is that once multiple runqueues are introduced,
+per-CPU or otherwise, there will be complex interactions as each runqueue will
+be responsible for the scheduling latency and fairness of the tasks only on its
+own runqueue, and to achieve fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any
+advantage in throughput of having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages.
+This is due to requiring a very complex balancing system to at best achieve some
+semblance of fairness across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency
+for tasks bound to the same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness
+and latency across CPUs, the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes
+for better scalability, is lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+A significant feature of BFS is that all accounting is done purely based on CPU
+used and nowhere is sleep time used in any way to determine entitlement or
+interactivity. Interactivity "estimators" that use some kind of sleep/run
+algorithm are doomed to fail to detect all interactive tasks, and to falsely tag
+tasks that aren't interactive as being so. The reason for this is that it is
+close to impossible to determine that when a task is sleeping, whether it is
+doing it voluntarily, as in a userspace application waiting for input in the
+form of a mouse click or otherwise, or involuntarily, because it is waiting for
+another thread, process, I/O, kernel activity or whatever. Thus, such an
+estimator will introduce corner cases, and more heuristics will be required to
+cope with those corner cases, introducing more corner cases and failed
+interactivity detection and so on. Interactivity in BFS is built into the design
+by virtue of the fact that tasks that are waking up have not used up their quota
+of CPU time, and have earlier effective deadlines, thereby making it very likely
+they will preempt any CPU bound task of equivalent nice level. See below for
+more information on the virtual deadline mechanism. Even if they do not preempt
+a running task, because the rr interval is guaranteed to have a bound upper
+limit on how long a task will wait for, it will be scheduled within a timeframe
+that will not cause visible interface jitter.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Task insertion.
+
+BFS inserts tasks into each relevant queue as an O(1) insertion into a double
+linked list. On insertion, *every* running queue is checked to see if the newly
+queued task can run on any idle queue, or preempt the lowest running task on the
+system. This is how the cross-CPU scheduling of BFS achieves significantly lower
+latency per extra CPU the system has. In this case the lookup is, in the worst
+case scenario, O(n) where n is the number of CPUs on the system.
+
+Data protection.
+
+BFS has one single lock protecting the process local data of every task in the
+global queue. Thus every insertion, removal and modification of task data in the
+global runqueue needs to grab the global lock. However, once a task is taken by
+a CPU, the CPU has its own local data copy of the running process' accounting
+information which only that CPU accesses and modifies (such as during a
+timer tick) thus allowing the accounting data to be updated lockless. Once a
+CPU has taken a task to run, it removes it from the global queue. Thus the
+global queue only ever has, at most,
+
+	(number of tasks requesting cpu time) - (number of logical CPUs) + 1
+
+tasks in the global queue. This value is relevant for the time taken to look up
+tasks during scheduling. This will increase if many tasks with CPU affinity set
+in their policy to limit which CPUs they're allowed to run on if they outnumber
+the number of CPUs. The +1 is because when rescheduling a task, the CPU's
+currently running task is put back on the queue. Lookup will be described after
+the virtual deadline mechanism is explained.
+
+Virtual deadline.
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in BFS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in BFS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in jiffies by this equation:
+
+	jiffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases. Once a task is descheduled, it is put back on the queue, and an
+O(n) lookup of all queued-but-not-running tasks is done to determine which has
+the earliest deadline and that task is chosen to receive CPU next.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (jiffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup.
+
+BFS has 103 priority queues. 100 of these are dedicated to the static priority
+of realtime tasks, and the remaining 3 are, in order of best to worst priority,
+SCHED_ISO (isochronous), SCHED_NORMAL, and SCHED_IDLEPRIO (idle priority
+scheduling). When a task of these priorities is queued, a bitmap of running
+priorities is set showing which of these priorities has tasks waiting for CPU
+time. When a CPU is made to reschedule, the lookup for the next task to get
+CPU time is performed in the following way:
+
+First the bitmap is checked to see what static priority tasks are queued. If
+any realtime priorities are found, the corresponding queue is checked and the
+first task listed there is taken (provided CPU affinity is suitable) and lookup
+is complete. If the priority corresponds to a SCHED_ISO task, they are also
+taken in FIFO order (as they behave like SCHED_RR). If the priority corresponds
+to either SCHED_NORMAL or SCHED_IDLEPRIO, then the lookup becomes O(n). At this
+stage, every task in the runlist that corresponds to that priority is checked
+to see which has the earliest set deadline, and (provided it has suitable CPU
+affinity) it is taken off the runqueue and given the CPU. If a task has an
+expired deadline, it is taken and the rest of the lookup aborted (as they are
+chosen in FIFO order).
+
+Thus, the lookup is O(n) in the worst case only, where n is as described
+earlier, as tasks may be chosen before the whole task list is looked over.
+
+
+Scalability.
+
+The major limitations of BFS will be that of scalability, as the separate
+runqueue designs will have less lock contention as the number of CPUs rises.
+However they do not scale linearly even with separate runqueues as multiple
+runqueues will need to be locked concurrently on such designs to be able to
+achieve fair CPU balancing, to try and achieve some sort of nice-level fairness
+across CPUs, and to achieve low enough latency for tasks on a busy CPU when
+other CPUs would be more suited. BFS has the advantage that it requires no
+balancing algorithm whatsoever, as balancing occurs by proxy simply because
+all CPUs draw off the global runqueue, in priority and deadline order. Despite
+the fact that scalability is _not_ the prime concern of BFS, it both shows very
+good scalability to smaller numbers of CPUs and is likely a more scalable design
+at these numbers of CPUs.
+
+It also has some very low overhead scalability features built into the design
+when it has been deemed their overhead is so marginal that they're worth adding.
+The first is the local copy of the running process' data to the CPU it's running
+on to allow that data to be updated lockless where possible. Then there is
+deference paid to the last CPU a task was running on, by trying that CPU first
+when looking for an idle CPU to use the next time it's scheduled. Finally there
+is the notion of cache locality beyond the last running CPU. The sched_domains
+information is used to determine the relative virtual "cache distance" that
+other CPUs have from the last CPU a task was running on. CPUs with shared
+caches, such as SMT siblings, or multicore CPUs with shared caches, are treated
+as cache local. CPUs without shared caches are treated as not cache local, and
+CPUs on different NUMA nodes are treated as very distant. This "relative cache
+distance" is used by modifying the virtual deadline value when doing lookups.
+Effectively, the deadline is unaltered between "cache local" CPUs, doubled for
+"cache distant" CPUs, and quadrupled for "very distant" CPUs. The reasoning
+behind the doubling of deadlines is as follows. The real cost of migrating a
+task from one CPU to another is entirely dependant on the cache footprint of
+the task, how cache intensive the task is, how long it's been running on that
+CPU to take up the bulk of its cache, how big the CPU cache is, how fast and
+how layered the CPU cache is, how fast a context switch is... and so on. In
+other words, it's close to random in the real world where we do more than just
+one sole workload. The only thing we can be sure of is that it's not free. So
+BFS uses the principle that an idle CPU is a wasted CPU and utilising idle CPUs
+is more important than cache locality, and cache locality only plays a part
+after that. Doubling the effective deadline is based on the premise that the
+"cache local" CPUs will tend to work on the same tasks up to double the number
+of cache local CPUs, and once the workload is beyond that amount, it is likely
+that none of the tasks are cache warm anywhere anyway. The quadrupling for NUMA
+is a value I pulled out of my arse.
+
+When choosing an idle CPU for a waking task, the cache locality is determined
+according to where the task last ran and then idle CPUs are ranked from best
+to worst to choose the most suitable idle CPU based on cache locality, NUMA
+node locality and hyperthread sibling business. They are chosen in the
+following preference (if idle):
+
+* Same core, idle or busy cache, idle threads
+* Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Same core, busy threads.
+* Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+* Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+* Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+This shows the SMT or "hyperthread" awareness in the design as well which will
+choose a real idle core first before a logical SMT sibling which already has
+tasks on the physical CPU.
+
+Early benchmarking of BFS suggested scalability dropped off at the 16 CPU mark.
+However this benchmarking was performed on an earlier design that was far less
+scalable than the current one so it's hard to know how scalable it is in terms
+of both CPUs (due to the global runqueue) and heavily loaded machines (due to
+O(n) lookup) at this stage. Note that in terms of scalability, the number of
+_logical_ CPUs matters, not the number of _physical_ CPUs. Thus, a dual (2x)
+quad core (4X) hyperthreaded (2X) machine is effectively a 16X. Newer benchmark
+results are very promising indeed, without needing to tweak any knobs, features
+or options. Benchmark contributions are most welcome.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for BFS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are precisely 2 tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval
+and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO policies. In addition
+to this, BFS also uses sub-tick accounting. What BFS does _not_ now feature is
+support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither need to know what these
+are, nor should they need to be using them to have good desktop behaviour.
+
+rr_interval
+
+There is only one "scheduler" tunable, the round robin interval. This can be
+accessed in
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6 on a
+uniprocessor machine, and automatically set to a progressively higher value on
+multiprocessor machines. The reasoning behind increasing the value on more CPUs
+is that the effective latency is decreased by virtue of there being more CPUs on
+BFS (for reasons explained above), and increasing the value allows for less
+cache contention and more throughput. Valid values are from 1 to 1000
+Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of decreasing
+throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the cost of
+worsening latencies. The accuracy of the rr interval is limited by HZ resolution
+of the kernel configuration. Thus, the worst case latencies are usually slightly
+higher than this actual value. The default value of 6 is not an arbitrary one.
+It is based on the fact that humans can detect jitter at approximately 7ms, so
+aiming for much lower latencies is pointless under most circumstances. It is
+worth noting this fact when comparing the latency performance of BFS to other
+schedulers. Worst case latencies being higher than 7ms are far worse than
+average latencies not being in the microsecond range.
+
+Isochronous scheduling.
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of _total CPU_ available across the machine, configurable
+as a percentage in the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a
+scheduler tunable):
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of BFS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+Because some applications constantly set their policy as well as their nice
+level, there is potential for them to undo the override specified by the user
+on the command line of setting the policy to SCHED_ISO. To counter this, once
+a task has been set to SCHED_ISO policy, it needs superuser privileges to set
+it back to SCHED_NORMAL. This will ensure the task remains ISO and all child
+processes and threads will also inherit the ISO policy.
+
+Idleprio scheduling.
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start
+a video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this
+policy from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it
+detects a state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to
+suspend to ram and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. As
+per the Isochronous task management, once a task has been scheduled as IDLEPRIO,
+it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without superuser privileges. Tasks can
+be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+	schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting.
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the
+timer tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application
+which uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records
+zero CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible
+security implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task
+really does use. BFS tries to use the sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock,
+where possible, to determine real CPU usage. This is not entirely reliable, but
+is far more likely to produce accurate CPU usage data than the existing designs
+and will not show tasks as consuming no CPU usage when they actually are. Thus,
+the amount of CPU reported as being used by BFS will more accurately represent
+how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for example by the 'time'
+application), so the reported values may be quite different to other schedulers.
+Values reported as the 'load' are more prone to problems with this design, but
+per process values are closer to real usage. When comparing throughput of BFS
+to other designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms
+of total wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported
+"cpu usage".

+MuQSS - The Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler by Con Kolivas.
+
+MuQSS is a per-cpu runqueue variant of the original BFS scheduler with
+one 8 level skiplist per runqueue, and fine grained locking for much more
+scalability.
+
+
+Goals.
+
+The goal of the Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler, referred to as MuQSS from
+here on (pronounced mux) is to completely do away with the complex designs of
+the past for the cpu process scheduler and instead implement one that is very
+simple in basic design. The main focus of MuQSS is to achieve excellent desktop
+interactivity and responsiveness without heuristics and tuning knobs that are
+difficult to understand, impossible to model and predict the effect of, and when
+tuned to one workload cause massive detriment to another, while still being
+scalable to many CPUs and processes.
+
+
+Design summary.
+
+MuQSS is best described as per-cpu multiple runqueue, O(log n) insertion, O(1)
+lookup, earliest effective virtual deadline first tickless design, loosely based
+on EEVDF (earliest eligible virtual deadline first) and my previous Staircase
+Deadline scheduler, and evolved from the single runqueue O(n) BFS scheduler.
+Each component shall be described in order to understand the significance of,
+and reasoning for it.
+
+
+Design reasoning.
+
+In BFS, the use of a single runqueue across all CPUs meant that each CPU would
+need to scan the entire runqueue looking for the process with the earliest
+deadline and schedule that next, regardless of which CPU it originally came
+from. This made BFS deterministic with respect to latency and provided
+guaranteed latencies dependent on number of processes and CPUs. The single
+runqueue, however, meant that all CPUs would compete for the single lock
+protecting it, which would lead to increasing lock contention as the number of
+CPUs rose and appeared to limit scalability of common workloads beyond 16
+logical CPUs. Additionally, the O(n) lookup of the runqueue list obviously
+increased overhead proportionate to the number of queued proecesses and led to
+cache thrashing while iterating over the linked list.
+
+MuQSS is an evolution of BFS, designed to maintain the same scheduling
+decision mechanism and be virtually deterministic without relying on the
+constrained design of the single runqueue by splitting out the single runqueue
+to be per-CPU and use skiplists instead of linked lists.
+
+The original reason for going back to a single runqueue design for BFS was that
+once multiple runqueues are introduced, per-CPU or otherwise, there will be
+complex interactions as each runqueue will be responsible for the scheduling
+latency and fairness of the tasks only on its own runqueue, and to achieve
+fairness and low latency across multiple CPUs, any advantage in throughput of
+having CPU local tasks causes other disadvantages. This is due to requiring a
+very complex balancing system to at best achieve some semblance of fairness
+across CPUs and can only maintain relatively low latency for tasks bound to the
+same CPUs, not across them. To increase said fairness and latency across CPUs,
+the advantage of local runqueue locking, which makes for better scalability, is
+lost due to having to grab multiple locks.
+
+MuQSS works around the problems inherent in multiple runqueue designs by
+making its skip lists priority ordered and through novel use of lockless
+examination of each other runqueue it can decide if it should take the earliest
+deadline task from another runqueue for latency reasons, or for CPU balancing
+reasons. It still does not have a balancing system, choosing to allow the
+next task scheduling decision and task wakeup CPU choice to allow balancing to
+happen by virtue of its choices.
+
+As a further evolution of the design, MuQSS normally configures sharing of
+runqueues in a logical fashion for when CPU resources are shared for improved
+latency and throughput. By default it shares runqueues and locks between
+multicore siblings. Optionally it can be configured to run with sharing of
+SMT siblings only, all SMP packages or no sharing at all. Additionally it can
+be selected at boot time.
+
+
+Design details.
+
+Custom skip list implementation:
+
+To avoid the overhead of building up and tearing down skip list structures,
+the variant used by MuQSS has a number of optimisations making it specific for
+its use case in the scheduler. It uses static arrays of 8 'levels' instead of
+building up and tearing down structures dynamically. This makes each runqueue
+only scale O(log N) up to 64k tasks. However as there is one runqueue per CPU
+it means that it scales O(log N) up to 64k x number of logical CPUs which is
+far beyond the realistic task limits each CPU could handle. By being 8 levels
+it also makes the array exactly one cacheline in size. Additionally, each
+skip list node is bidirectional making insertion and removal amortised O(1),
+being O(k) where k is 1-8. Uniquely, we are only ever interested in the very
+first entry in each list at all times with MuQSS, so there is never a need to
+do a search and thus look up is always O(1). In interactive mode, the queues
+will be searched beyond their first entry if the first task is not suitable
+for affinity or SMT nice reasons.
+
+Task insertion:
+
+MuQSS inserts tasks into a per CPU runqueue as an O(log N) insertion into
+a custom skip list as described above (based on the original design by William
+Pugh). Insertion is ordered in such a way that there is never a need to do a
+search by ordering tasks according to static priority primarily, and then
+virtual deadline at the time of insertion.
+
+Niffies:
+
+Niffies are a monotonic forward moving timer not unlike the "jiffies" but are
+of nanosecond resolution. Niffies are calculated per-runqueue from the high
+resolution TSC timers, and in order to maintain fairness are synchronised
+between CPUs whenever both runqueues are locked concurrently.
+
+Virtual deadline:
+
+The key to achieving low latency, scheduling fairness, and "nice level"
+distribution in MuQSS is entirely in the virtual deadline mechanism. The one
+tunable in MuQSS is the rr_interval, or "round robin interval". This is the
+maximum time two SCHED_OTHER (or SCHED_NORMAL, the common scheduling policy)
+tasks of the same nice level will be running for, or looking at it the other
+way around, the longest duration two tasks of the same nice level will be
+delayed for. When a task requests cpu time, it is given a quota (time_slice)
+equal to the rr_interval and a virtual deadline. The virtual deadline is
+offset from the current time in niffies by this equation:
+
+	niffies + (prio_ratio * rr_interval)
+
+The prio_ratio is determined as a ratio compared to the baseline of nice -20
+and increases by 10% per nice level. The deadline is a virtual one only in that
+no guarantee is placed that a task will actually be scheduled by this time, but
+it is used to compare which task should go next. There are three components to
+how a task is next chosen. First is time_slice expiration. If a task runs out
+of its time_slice, it is descheduled, the time_slice is refilled, and the
+deadline reset to that formula above. Second is sleep, where a task no longer
+is requesting CPU for whatever reason. The time_slice and deadline are _not_
+adjusted in this case and are just carried over for when the task is next
+scheduled. Third is preemption, and that is when a newly waking task is deemed
+higher priority than a currently running task on any cpu by virtue of the fact
+that it has an earlier virtual deadline than the currently running task. The
+earlier deadline is the key to which task is next chosen for the first and
+second cases.
+
+The CPU proportion of different nice tasks works out to be approximately the
+
+	(prio_ratio difference)^2
+
+The reason it is squared is that a task's deadline does not change while it is
+running unless it runs out of time_slice. Thus, even if the time actually
+passes the deadline of another task that is queued, it will not get CPU time
+unless the current running task deschedules, and the time "base" (niffies) is
+constantly moving.
+
+Task lookup:
+
+As tasks are already pre-ordered according to anticipated scheduling order in
+the skip lists, lookup for the next suitable task per-runqueue is always a
+matter of simply selecting the first task in the 0th level skip list entry.
+In order to maintain optimal latency and fairness across CPUs, MuQSS does a
+novel examination of every other runqueue in cache locality order, choosing the
+best task across all runqueues. This provides near-determinism of how long any
+task across the entire system may wait before receiving CPU time. The other
+runqueues are first examine lockless and then trylocked to minimise the
+potential lock contention if they are likely to have a suitable better task.
+Each other runqueue lock is only held for as long as it takes to examine the
+entry for suitability. In "interactive" mode, the default setting, MuQSS will
+look for the best deadline task across all CPUs, while in !interactive mode,
+it will only select a better deadline task from another CPU if it is more
+heavily laden than the current one.
+
+Lookup is therefore O(k) where k is number of CPUs.
+
+
+Latency.
+
+Through the use of virtual deadlines to govern the scheduling order of normal
+tasks, queue-to-activation latency per runqueue is guaranteed to be bound by
+the rr_interval tunable which is set to 6ms by default. This means that the
+longest a CPU bound task will wait for more CPU is proportional to the number
+of running tasks and in the common case of 0-2 running tasks per CPU, will be
+under the 7ms threshold for human perception of jitter. Additionally, as newly
+woken tasks will have an early deadline from their previous runtime, the very
+tasks that are usually latency sensitive will have the shortest interval for
+activation, usually preempting any existing CPU bound tasks.
+
+Tickless expiry:
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it is not tied to the resolution of the chosen tick
+rate in Hz, instead depending entirely on the high resolution timers where
+possible for sub-millisecond accuracy on timeouts regarless of the underlying
+tick rate. This allows MuQSS to be run with the low overhead of low Hz rates
+such as 100 by default, benefiting from the improved throughput and lower
+power usage it provides. Another advantage of this approach is that in
+combination with the Full No HZ option, which disables ticks on running task
+CPUs instead of just idle CPUs, the tick can be disabled at all times
+regardless of how many tasks are running instead of being limited to just one
+running task. Note that this option is NOT recommended for regular desktop
+users.
+
+
+Scalability and balancing.
+
+Unlike traditional approaches where balancing is a combination of CPU selection
+at task wakeup and intermittent balancing based on a vast array of rules set
+according to architecture, busyness calculations and special case management,
+MuQSS indirectly balances on the fly at task wakeup and next task selection.
+During initialisation, MuQSS creates a cache coherency ordered list of CPUs for
+each logical CPU and uses this to aid task/CPU selection when CPUs are busy.
+Additionally it selects any idle CPUs, if they are available, at any time over
+busy CPUs according to the following preference:
+
+ * Same thread, idle or busy cache, idle or busy threads
+ * Other core, same cache, idle or busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other core, same cache, busy threads.
+ * Same node, other CPU, busy threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, idle cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy cache, idle threads.
+ * Other node, other CPU, busy threads.
+
+Mux is therefore SMT, MC and Numa aware without the need for extra
+intermittent balancing to maintain CPUs busy and make the most of cache
+coherency.
+
+
+Features
+
+As the initial prime target audience for MuQSS was the average desktop user, it
+was designed to not need tweaking, tuning or have features set to obtain benefit
+from it. Thus the number of knobs and features has been kept to an absolute
+minimum and should not require extra user input for the vast majority of cases.
+There are 3 optional tunables, and 2 extra scheduling policies. The rr_interval,
+interactive, and iso_cpu tunables, and the SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO
+policies. In addition to this, MuQSS also uses sub-tick accounting. What MuQSS
+does _not_ now feature is support for CGROUPS. The average user should neither
+need to know what these are, nor should they need to be using them to have good
+desktop behaviour. However since some applications refuse to work without
+cgroups, one can enable them with MuQSS as a stub and the filesystem will be
+created which will allow the applications to work.
+
+rr_interval:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/rr_interval
+
+The value is in milliseconds, and the default value is set to 6. Valid values
+are from 1 to 1000 Decreasing the value will decrease latencies at the cost of
+decreasing throughput, while increasing it will improve throughput, but at the
+cost of worsening latencies. It is based on the fact that humans can detect
+jitter at approximately 7ms, so aiming for much lower latencies is pointless
+under most circumstances. It is worth noting this fact when comparing the
+latency performance of MuQSS to other schedulers. Worst case latencies being
+higher than 7ms are far worse than average latencies not being in the
+microsecond range.
+
+interactive:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/interactive
+
+The value is a simple boolean of 1 for on and 0 for off and is set to on by
+default. Disabling this will disable the near-determinism of MuQSS when
+selecting the next task by not examining all CPUs for the earliest deadline
+task, or which CPU to wake to, instead prioritising CPU balancing for improved
+throughput. Latency will still be bound by rr_interval, but on a per-CPU basis
+instead of across the whole system.
+
+Runqueue sharing.
+
+By default MuQSS chooses to share runqueue resources (specifically the skip
+list and locking) between multicore siblings. It is configurable at build time
+to select between None, SMT, MC and SMP, corresponding to no sharing, sharing
+only between simultaneous mulithreading siblings, multicore siblings, or
+symmetric multiprocessing physical packages. Additionally it can be se at
+bootime with the use of the rqshare parameter. The reason for configurability
+is that some architectures have CPUs with many multicore siblings (>= 16)
+where it may be detrimental to throughput to share runqueues and another
+sharing option may be desirable. Additionally, more sharing than usual can
+improve latency on a system-wide level at the expense of throughput if desired.
+
+The options are:
+none, smt, mc, smp
+
+eg:
+	rqshare=mc
+
+Isochronous scheduling:
+
+Isochronous scheduling is a unique scheduling policy designed to provide
+near-real-time performance to unprivileged (ie non-root) users without the
+ability to starve the machine indefinitely. Isochronous tasks (which means
+"same time") are set using, for example, the schedtool application like so:
+
+	schedtool -I -e amarok
+
+This will start the audio application "amarok" as SCHED_ISO. How SCHED_ISO works
+is that it has a priority level between true realtime tasks and SCHED_NORMAL
+which would allow them to preempt all normal tasks, in a SCHED_RR fashion (ie,
+if multiple SCHED_ISO tasks are running, they purely round robin at rr_interval
+rate). However if ISO tasks run for more than a tunable finite amount of time,
+they are then demoted back to SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. This finite amount of
+time is the percentage of CPU available per CPU, configurable as a percentage in
+the following "resource handling" tunable (as opposed to a scheduler tunable):
+
+iso_cpu:
+
+	/proc/sys/kernel/iso_cpu
+
+and is set to 70% by default. It is calculated over a rolling 5 second average
+Because it is the total CPU available, it means that on a multi CPU machine, it
+is possible to have an ISO task running as realtime scheduling indefinitely on
+just one CPU, as the other CPUs will be available. Setting this to 100 is the
+equivalent of giving all users SCHED_RR access and setting it to 0 removes the
+ability to run any pseudo-realtime tasks.
+
+A feature of MuQSS is that it detects when an application tries to obtain a
+realtime policy (SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO) and the caller does not have the
+appropriate privileges to use those policies. When it detects this, it will
+give the task SCHED_ISO policy instead. Thus it is transparent to the user.
+
+
+Idleprio scheduling:
+
+Idleprio scheduling is a scheduling policy designed to give out CPU to a task
+_only_ when the CPU would be otherwise idle. The idea behind this is to allow
+ultra low priority tasks to be run in the background that have virtually no
+effect on the foreground tasks. This is ideally suited to distributed computing
+clients (like setiathome, folding, mprime etc) but can also be used to start a
+video encode or so on without any slowdown of other tasks. To avoid this policy
+from grabbing shared resources and holding them indefinitely, if it detects a
+state where the task is waiting on I/O, the machine is about to suspend to ram
+and so on, it will transiently schedule them as SCHED_NORMAL. Once a task has
+been scheduled as IDLEPRIO, it cannot be put back to SCHED_NORMAL without
+superuser privileges since it is effectively a lower scheduling policy. Tasks
+can be set to start as SCHED_IDLEPRIO with the schedtool command like so:
+
+schedtool -D -e ./mprime
+
+Subtick accounting:
+
+It is surprisingly difficult to get accurate CPU accounting, and in many cases,
+the accounting is done by simply determining what is happening at the precise
+moment a timer tick fires off. This becomes increasingly inaccurate as the timer
+tick frequency (HZ) is lowered. It is possible to create an application which
+uses almost 100% CPU, yet by being descheduled at the right time, records zero
+CPU usage. While the main problem with this is that there are possible security
+implications, it is also difficult to determine how much CPU a task really does
+use. Mux uses sub-tick accounting from the TSC clock to determine real CPU
+usage. Thus, the amount of CPU reported as being used by MuQSS will more
+accurately represent how much CPU the task itself is using (as is shown for
+example by the 'time' application), so the reported values may be quite
+different to other schedulers. When comparing throughput of MuQSS to other
+designs, it is important to compare the actual completed work in terms of total
+wall clock time taken and total work done, rather than the reported "cpu usage".
+
+Symmetric MultiThreading (SMT) aware nice:
+
+SMT, a.k.a. hyperthreading, is a very common feature on modern CPUs. While the
+logical CPU count rises by adding thread units to each CPU core, allowing more
+than one task to be run simultaneously on the same core, the disadvantage of it
+is that the CPU power is shared between the tasks, not summating to the power
+of two CPUs. The practical upshot of this is that two tasks running on
+separate threads of the same core run significantly slower than if they had one
+core each to run on. While smart CPU selection allows each task to have a core
+to itself whenever available (as is done on MuQSS), it cannot offset the
+slowdown that occurs when the cores are all loaded and only a thread is left.
+Most of the time this is harmless as the CPU is effectively overloaded at this
+point and the extra thread is of benefit. However when running a niced task in
+the presence of an un-niced task (say nice 19 v nice 0), the nice task gets
+precisely the same amount of CPU power as the unniced one. MuQSS has an
+optional configuration feature known as SMT-NICE which selectively idles the
+secondary niced thread for a period proportional to the nice difference,
+allowing CPU distribution according to nice level to be maintained, at the
+expense of a small amount of extra overhead. If this is configured in on a
+machine without SMT threads, the overhead is minimal.

+Description
+-----------
+
+ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS
+(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
+hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.
+
+This driver exposes some features of the SMAPI BIOS through a sysfs
+interface. It is suitable for newer models, on which SMAPI is invoked
+through IO port writes. Older models use a different SMAPI interface;
+for those, try the "thinkpad" module from the "tpctl" package.
+
+WARNING:
+This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
+It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
+(especially on models it wasn't tested on).
+
+
+Module parameters
+-----------------
+
+thinkpad_ec module:
+  force_io=1 lets thinkpad_ec load on some recent ThinkPad models
+  (e.g., T400 and T500) whose BIOS's ACPI DSDT reserves the ports we need.
+tp_smapi module:
+  debug=1    enables verbose dmesg output.
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+Control of battery charging thresholds (in percents of current full charge
+capacity):
+
+# echo 40 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh
+# echo 70 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/*_charge_thresh
+
+    (This is useful since Li-Ion batteries wear out much faster at very
+     high or low charge levels. The driver will also keeps the thresholds
+     across suspend-to-disk with AC disconnected; this isn't done
+     automatically by the hardware.)
+
+Inhibiting battery charging for 17 minutes (overrides thresholds):
+
+# echo 17 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+# echo 0  > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes  # stop
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+
+    (This can be used to control which battery is charged when using an
+     Ultrabay battery.)
+
+Forcing battery discharging even if AC power available:
+
+# echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # start discharge
+# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # stop discharge
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge
+
+    (When AC is connected, forced discharging will automatically stop
+     when battery is fully depleted -- this is useful for calibration.
+     Also, this attribute can be used to control which battery is discharged
+     when both a system battery and an Ultrabay battery are connected.)
+
+Misc read-only battery status attributes (see note about HDAPS below):
+
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/installed   # 0 or 1
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/state       # idle/charging/discharging
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/cycle_count # integer counter
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/current_now # instantaneous current
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/current_avg # last minute average
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/power_now   # instantaneous power
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/power_avg   # last minute average
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/last_full_capacity         # in mWh
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_percent          # remaining percent of energy (set by calibration)
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_percent_error    # error range of remaing_percent (not reset by calibration)
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_running_time     # in minutes, by last minute average power
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_running_time_now # in minutes, by instantenous power
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_charging_time    # in minutes
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_capacity         # in mWh
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/design_capacity            # in mWh
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/voltage           # in mV
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/design_voltage    # in mV
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/charging_max_current  # max charging current
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/charging_max_voltage  # max charging voltage
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/group{0,1,2,3}_voltage # see below
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/manufacturer      # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/model             # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/barcoding         # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/chemistry         # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/serial            # integer
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/manufacture_date  # YYYY-MM-DD
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/first_use_date    # YYYY-MM-DD
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/temperature  # in milli-Celsius
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/dump         # see below
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/ac_connected      # 0 or 1
+
+The BAT0/group{0,1,2,3}_voltage attribute refers to the separate cell groups
+in each battery. For example, on the ThinkPad 600, X3x, T4x and R5x models,
+the battery contains 3 cell groups in series, where each group consisting of 2
+or 3 cells  connected in parallel. The voltage of each group is given by these
+attributes, and their sum (roughly) equals the "voltage" attribute.
+(The effective performance of the battery is determined by the weakest group,
+i.e., the one those voltage changes most rapidly during dis/charging.)
+
+The "BAT0/dump" attribute gives a a hex dump of the raw status data, which
+contains additional data now in the above (if you can figure it out). Some
+unused values are autodetected and replaced by "--":
+
+In all of the above, replace BAT0 with BAT1 to address the 2nd battery (e.g.
+in the UltraBay).
+
+
+Raw SMAPI calls:
+
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+This performs raw SMAPI calls. It uses a bad interface that cannot handle
+multiple simultaneous access. Don't touch it, it's for development only.
+If you did touch it, you would so something like
+# echo '211a 100 0 0' > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+and notice that in the output "211a 34b b2 0 0 0 'OK'", the "4b" in the 2nd
+value, converted to decimal is 75: the current charge stop threshold.
+
+
+Model-specific status
+---------------------
+
+Works (at least partially) on the following ThinkPad model:
+* A30
+* G41
+* R40, R50p, R51, R52
+* T23, T40, T40p, T41, T41p, T42, T42p, T43, T43p, T60, T61, T400, T410, T420 (partially)
+* X24, X31, X32, X40, X41, X60, X61, X200, X201, X220 (partially)
+* Z60t, Z61m
+
+Does not work on:
+* X230 and newer
+* T430 and newer
+* Any ThinkPad Edge
+* Any ThinkPad Yoga
+* Any ThinkPad L series
+* Any ThinkPad P series
+
+Not all functions are available on all models; for detailed status, see:
+  http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi
+
+Please report success/failure by e-mail or on the Wiki.
+If you get a "not implemented" or "not supported" message, your laptop
+probably just can't do that (at least not via the SMAPI BIOS).
+For negative reports, follow the bug reporting guidelines below.
+If you send me the necessary technical data (i.e., SMAPI function
+interfaces), I will support additional models.
+
+
+Additional HDAPS features
+-------------------------
+
+The modified hdaps driver has several improvements on the one in mainline
+(beyond resolving the conflict with thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi):
+
+- Fixes reliability and improves support for recent ThinkPad models
+  (especially *60 and newer). Unlike the mainline driver, the modified hdaps
+  correctly follows the Embedded Controller communication protocol.
+
+- Extends the "invert" parameter to cover all possible axis orientations.
+  The possible values are as follows.
+  Let X,Y denote the hardware readouts.
+  Let R denote the laptop's roll (tilt left/right).
+  Let P denote the laptop's pitch (tilt forward/backward).
+    invert=0:   R= X  P= Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=1:   R=-X  P=-Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=2:   R=-X  P= Y   (new)
+    invert=3:   R= X  P=-Y   (new)
+    invert=4:   R= Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=5:   R=-Y  P=-X   (new)
+    invert=6:   R=-Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=7:   R= Y  P=-X   (new)
+  It's probably easiest to just try all 8 possibilities and see which yields
+  correct results (e.g., in the hdaps-gl visualisation).
+
+- Adds a whitelist which automatically sets the correct axis orientation for
+  some models. If the value for your model is wrong or missing, you can override
+  it using the "invert" parameter. Please also update the tables at
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi and
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/List_of_DMI_IDs
+  and submit a patch for the whitelist in hdaps.c.
+
+- Provides new attributes:
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/sampling_rate:
+    This determines the frequency at which the host queries the embedded
+    controller for accelerometer data (and informs the hdaps input devices).
+    Default=50.
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/oversampling_ratio:
+    When set to X, the embedded controller is told to do physical accelerometer
+    measurements at a rate that is X times higher than the rate at which
+    the driver reads those measurements (i.e., X*sampling_rate). This
+    makes the readouts from the embedded controller more fresh, and is also
+    useful for the running average filter (see next). Default=5
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/running_avg_filter_order:
+    When set to X, reported readouts will be the average of the last X physical
+    accelerometer measurements. Current firmware allows 1<=X<=8. Setting to a
+    high value decreases readout fluctuations. The averaging is handled by the
+    embedded controller, so no CPU resources are used. Higher values make the
+    readouts smoother, since it averages out both sensor noise (good) and abrupt
+    changes (bad). Default=2.
+
+- Provides a second input device, which publishes the raw accelerometer
+  measurements (without the fuzzing needed for joystick emulation). This input
+  device can be matched by a udev rule such as the following (all on one line):
+    KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{phys}=="hdaps/input1",
+    ATTRS{modalias}=="input:b0019v1014p5054e4801-*",
+    SYMLINK+="input/hdaps/accelerometer-event
+
+A new version of the hdapsd userspace daemon, which uses the input device
+interface instead of polling sysfs, is available seprately. Using this reduces
+the total interrupts per second generated by hdaps+hdapsd (on tickless kernels)
+to 50, down from a value that fluctuates between 50 and 100. Set the
+sampling_rate sysfs attribute to a lower value to further reduce interrupts,
+at the expense of response latency.
+
+Licensing note: all my changes to the HDAPS driver are licensed under the
+GPL version 2 or, at your option and to the extent allowed by derivation from
+prior works, any later version. My version of hdaps is derived work from the
+mainline version, which at the time of writing is available only under
+GPL version 2.
+
+Bug reporting
+-------------
+
+Mail <multinymous@gmail.com>. Please include:
+* Details about your model,
+* Relevant "dmesg" output. Make sure thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi are loaded with
+  the "debug=1" parameter (e.g., use "make load HDAPS=1 DEBUG=1").
+* Output of "dmidecode | grep -C5 Product"
+* Does the failed functionality works under Windows?
+
+
+More about SMAPI
+----------------
+
+For hints about what may be possible via the SMAPI BIOS and how, see:
+
+* IBM Technical Reference Manual for the ThinkPad 770
+  (http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=PFAN-3TUQQD)
+* Exported symbols in PWRMGRIF.DLL or TPPWRW32.DLL (e.g., use "objdump -x").
+* drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c in the Linux kernel tree.*
+* The "thinkpad" SMAPI module (http://tpctl.sourceforge.net).
+* The SMAPI_* constants in tp_smapi.c.
+
+Note that in the above Technical Reference and in the "thinkpad" module,
+SMAPI is invoked through a function call to some physical address. However,
+the interface used by tp_smapi and the above mwave drive, and apparently
+required by newer ThinkPad, is different: you set the parameters up in the
+CPU's registers and write to ports 0xB2 (the APM control port) and 0x4F; this
+triggers an SMI (System Management Interrupt), causing the CPU to enter
+SMM (System Management Mode) and run the BIOS firmware; the results are
+returned in the CPU's registers. It is not clear what is the relation between
+the two variants of SMAPI, though the assignment of error codes seems to be
+similar.
+
+In addition, the embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard
+interface at IO ports 0x1600-0x161F (mapped to LCP channel 3 of the H8S chip).
+The interface provides various system management services (currently known:
+battery information and accelerometer readouts). For more information see the
+thinkpad_ec module and the H8S hardware documentation:
+http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/mpumcu/rej09b0300_2140bhm.pdf

+	 * Update blkg_path for bfq_log_* functions. We cache this
+	 * path, and update it here, for the following
+	 * reasons. Operations on blkg objects in blk-cgroup are
+	 * protected with the request_queue lock, and not with the
+	 * lock that protects the instances of this scheduler
+	 * (bfqd->lock). This exposes BFQ to the following sort of
+	 * race.
+	 *
+	 * The blkg_lookup performed in bfq_get_queue, protected
+	 * through rcu, may happen to return the address of a copy of
+	 * the original blkg. If this is the case, then the
+	 * bfqg_and_blkg_get performed in bfq_get_queue, to pin down
+	 * the blkg, is useless: it does not prevent blk-cgroup code
+	 * from destroying both the original blkg and all objects
+	 * directly or indirectly referred by the copy of the
+	 * blkg.
+	 *
+	 * On the bright side, destroy operations on a blkg invoke, as
+	 * a first step, hooks of the scheduler associated with the
+	 * blkg. And these hooks are executed with bfqd->lock held for
+	 * BFQ. As a consequence, for any blkg associated with the
+	 * request queue this instance of the scheduler is attached
+	 * to, we are guaranteed that such a blkg is not destroyed, and
+	 * that all the pointers it contains are consistent, while we
+	 * are holding bfqd->lock. A blkg_lookup performed with
+	 * bfqd->lock held then returns a fully consistent blkg, which
+	 * remains consistent until this lock is held.
+	 *
+	 * Thanks to the last fact, and to the fact that: (1) bfqg has
+	 * been obtained through a blkg_lookup in the above
+	 * assignment, and (2) bfqd->lock is being held, here we can
+	 * safely use the policy data for the involved blkg (i.e., the
+	 * field bfqg->pd) to get to the blkg associated with bfqg,
+	 * and then we can safely use any field of blkg. After we
+	 * release bfqd->lock, even just getting blkg through this
+	 * bfqg may cause dangling references to be traversed, as
+	 * bfqg->pd may not exist any more.
+	 *
+	 * In view of the above facts, here we cache, in the bfqg, any
+	 * blkg data we may need for this bic, and for its associated
+	 * bfq_queue. As of now, we need to cache only the path of the
+	 * blkg, which is used in the bfq_log_* functions.
+	 *
+	 * Finally, note that bfqg itself needs to be protected from
+	 * destruction on the blkg_free of the original blkg (which
+	 * invokes bfq_pd_free). We use an additional private
+	 * refcounter for bfqg, to let it disappear only after no
+	 * bfq_queue refers to it any longer.

+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * In particular, BFQ schedules I/O so as to achieve the latter goal--
+ * low latency for interactive and soft real-time applications--if the
+ * low_latency parameter is set (default configuration). To this
+ * purpose, BFQ constantly tries to detect whether the I/O requests in
+ * a bfq_queue come from an interactive or a soft real-time
+ * application. For brevity, in these cases, the queue is said to be
+ * interactive or soft real-time. In both cases, BFQ privileges the
+ * service of the queue, over that of non-interactive and
+ * non-soft-real-time queues. This privileging is performed, mainly,
+ * by raising the weight of the queue. So, for brevity, we call just
+ * weight-raising periods the time periods during which a queue is
+ * privileged, because deemed interactive or soft real-time.
+ *
+ * The detection of soft real-time queues/applications is described in
+ * detail in the comments on the function
+ * bfq_bfqq_softrt_next_start. On the other hand, the detection of an
+ * interactive queue works as follows: a queue is deemed interactive
+ * if it is constantly non empty only for a limited time interval,
+ * after which it does become empty. The queue may be deemed
+ * interactive again (for a limited time), if it restarts being
+ * constantly non empty, provided that this happens only after the
+ * queue has remained empty for a given minimum idle time.
+ *
+ * By default, BFQ computes automatically the above maximum time
+ * interval, i.e., the time interval after which a constantly
+ * non-empty queue stops being deemed interactive. Since a queue is
+ * weight-raised while it is deemed interactive, this maximum time
+ * interval happens to coincide with the (maximum) duration of the
+ * weight-raising for interactive queues.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial,
+ * more theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader
+ * can find in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as
+ * well as formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the
+ * properties.  With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these
+ * papers, this implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the
+ * one that guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications,
+ * and a hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * where r is the peak rate of the device, and ref_rate and

+ * is, the more/less it takes to load applications with respect to the
+ * reference device.  Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants
+ * weight raising to interactive applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses two different reference pairs (ref_rate, ref_wr_duration),
+ * depending on whether the device is rotational or non-rotational.
+ *
+ * In the following definitions, ref_rate[0] and ref_wr_duration[0]
+ * are the reference values for a rotational device, whereas
+ * ref_rate[1] and ref_wr_duration[1] are the reference values for a
+ * non-rotational device. The reference rates are not the actual peak
+ * rates of the devices used as a reference, but slightly lower
+ * values. The reason for using slightly lower values is that the
+ * peak-rate estimator tends to yield slightly lower values than the
+ * actual peak rate (it can yield the actual peak rate only if there
+ * is only one process doing I/O, and the process does sequential
+ * I/O).
+ *
+ * The reference peak rates are measured in sectors/usec, left-shifted

+ * BFQ uses the above-detailed, time-based weight-raising mechanism to
+ * privilege interactive tasks. This mechanism is vulnerable to the
+ * following false positives: I/O-bound applications that will go on
+ * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
+ * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
+ * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
+ * while being weight-raised, these applications
+ * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
+ * low latency;
+ * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
+ * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
+ * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
+ *
+ * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
+ * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
+ * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
+ * interactive tasks is computed.
+ *
+ * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
+ * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
+ * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
+ * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
+ * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
+ * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
+ * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
+ * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
+ * sectors transferred.
+ *
+ * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
+ * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
+ * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
+ * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
+ * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
+ * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
+ * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
+ * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
+ * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
+ * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
+ * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
+ * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
+ * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
+ *
+ * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
+ * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
+ * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
+ * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
+ *
+ * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
+ * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created

+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time

+
+/*
+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two

+ * record a compressed high-definition video.
+ * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may
+ * happen to meet, occasionally or systematically, both the above
+ * bandwidth and isochrony requirements. This may happen at least in
+ * the following circumstances. First, if the CPU load is high. The
+ * application may stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy
+ * serving other processes, then restart, then stop again for a while,
+ * and so on. The other circumstances are related to the storage
+ * device: the storage device is highly loaded or reaches a low-enough
+ * throughput with the I/O of the application (e.g., because the I/O
+ * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
+ * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
+ * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
+ * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
+ * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: the return value of this function is forced to
+ * be higher than the maximum between the following two quantities.
+ *
+ * (a) Current time plus: (1) the maximum time for which the arrival
+ *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
+ *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
+ *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
+ *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
+ *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
+ *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
+ *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
+ *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
+ *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
+ *     batch of its requests has been completed.
+ *
+ * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
+ *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
+ *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
+ *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
+ *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
+ *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
+ *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
+ *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
+ *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
+ *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
+ *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
+ *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
+ *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
+ *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
+ *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
+ *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
+ *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
+ *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
+ *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
+ *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
+ *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
+ *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
+ *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
+ *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
+ *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
+ *
+ * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
+ * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
+ * application, if the reference quantity was just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
+ *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
+ *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
+ *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
+ *    is rather lower than the exact value.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
+ * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
+ * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite

+	 * pool, before the busy weight-raised queues get served

+	 * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
+	 * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
+	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+	 * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+	 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()). In particular, if bfqq is being
+	 * weight-raised, it is important to idle only if there are
+	 * other, non-weight-raised queues that may steal throughput
+	 * to bfqq. Actually, we should be even more precise, and
+	 * differentiate between interactive weight raising and
+	 * soft real-time weight raising.
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+	 * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible

+ *
+ * Licensed under the GPL-2 as detailed in the accompanying COPYING.BFQ
+ * file.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * In particular, BFQ schedules I/O so as to achieve the latter goal--
+ * low latency for interactive and soft real-time applications--if the
+ * low_latency parameter is set (default configuration). To this
+ * purpose, BFQ constantly tries to detect whether the I/O requests in
+ * a bfq_queue come from an interactive or a soft real-time
+ * application. For brevity, in these cases, the queue is said to be
+ * interactive or soft real-time. In both cases, BFQ privileges the
+ * service of the queue, over that of non-interactive and
+ * non-soft-real-time queues. This privileging is performed, mainly,
+ * by raising the weight of the queue. So, for brevity, we call just
+ * weight-raising periods the time periods during which a queue is
+ * privileged, because deemed interactive or soft real-time.
+ *
+ * The detection of soft real-time queues/applications is described in
+ * detail in the comments on the function
+ * bfq_bfqq_softrt_next_start. On the other hand, the detection of an
+ * interactive queue works as follows: a queue is deemed interactive
+ * if it is constantly non empty only for a limited time interval,
+ * after which it does become empty. The queue may be deemed
+ * interactive again (for a limited time), if it restarts being
+ * constantly non empty, provided that this happens only after the
+ * queue has remained empty for a given minimum idle time.
+ *
+ * By default, BFQ computes automatically the above maximum time
+ * interval, i.e., the time interval after which a constantly
+ * non-empty queue stops being deemed interactive. Since a queue is
+ * weight-raised while it is deemed interactive, this maximum time
+ * interval happens to coincide with the (maximum) duration of the
+ * weight-raising for interactive queues.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial,
+ * more theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader
+ * can find in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as
+ * well as formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the
+ * properties.  With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these
+ * papers, this implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the
+ * one that guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications,
+ * and a hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * where r is the peak rate of the device, and ref_rate and
+ * ref_wr_duration are two reference parameters.  In particular,
+ * ref_rate is the peak rate of the reference storage device (see

+ * is, the more/less it takes to load applications with respect to the
+ * reference device.  Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants
+ * weight raising to interactive applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses two different reference pairs (ref_rate, ref_wr_duration),
+ * depending on whether the device is rotational or non-rotational.
+ *
+ * In the following definitions, ref_rate[0] and ref_wr_duration[0]
+ * are the reference values for a rotational device, whereas
+ * ref_rate[1] and ref_wr_duration[1] are the reference values for a
+ * non-rotational device. The reference rates are not the actual peak
+ * rates of the devices used as a reference, but slightly lower
+ * values. The reason for using slightly lower values is that the
+ * peak-rate estimator tends to yield slightly lower values than the
+ * actual peak rate (it can yield the actual peak rate only if there
+ * is only one process doing I/O, and the process does sequential
+ * I/O).

+ * BFQ uses the above-detailed, time-based weight-raising mechanism to
+ * privilege interactive tasks. This mechanism is vulnerable to the
+ * following false positives: I/O-bound applications that will go on
+ * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
+ * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
+ * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
+ * while being weight-raised, these applications
+ * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
+ * low latency;
+ * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
+ * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
+ * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
+ *
+ * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
+ * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
+ * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
+ * interactive tasks is computed.
+ *
+ * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
+ * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
+ * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
+ * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
+ * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
+ * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
+ * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
+ * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
+ * sectors transfered.
+ *
+ * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
+ * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
+ * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
+ * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
+ * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
+ * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
+ * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
+ * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
+ * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
+ * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
+ * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
+ * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
+ * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
+ *
+ * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
+ * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
+ * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
+ * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
+ *
+ * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
+ * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems
+ * described at the beginning of these comments.

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created

+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q
+ *          after this step).

+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * their chances to lower the throughput. More details in the comments
+ * on the function bfq_bfqq_expire().
+ *
+ * An important observation is in order: as discussed in the comments
+ * on the function bfq_update_peak_rate(), with devices with internal
+ * queues, it is hard if ever possible to know when and for how long
+ * an I/O request is processed by the device (apart from the trivial
+ * I/O pattern where a new request is dispatched only after the
+ * previous one has been completed). This makes it hard to evaluate
+ * the real rate at which the I/O requests of each bfq_queue are
+ * served.  In fact, for an I/O scheduler like BFQ, serving a
+ * bfq_queue means just dispatching its requests during its service
+ * slot (i.e., until the budget of the queue is exhausted, or the
+ * queue remains idle, or, finally, a timeout fires). But, during the
+ * service slot of a bfq_queue, around 100 ms at most, the device may
+ * be even still processing requests of bfq_queues served in previous
+ * service slots. On the opposite end, the requests of the in-service
+ * bfq_queue may be completed after the service slot of the queue
+ * finishes.
+ *
+ * Anyway, unless more sophisticated solutions are used
+ * (where possible), the sum of the sizes of the requests dispatched
+ * during the service slot of a bfq_queue is probably the only
+ * approximation available for the service received by the bfq_queue
+ * during its service slot. And this sum is the quantity used in this
+ * function to evaluate the I/O speed of a process.

+ * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two

+ * record a compressed high-definition video.
+ * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may
+ * happen to meet, occasionally or systematically, both the above
+ * bandwidth and isochrony requirements. This may happen at least in
+ * the following circumstances. First, if the CPU load is high. The
+ * application may stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy
+ * serving other processes, then restart, then stop again for a while,
+ * and so on. The other circumstances are related to the storage
+ * device: the storage device is highly loaded or reaches a low-enough
+ * throughput with the I/O of the application (e.g., because the I/O
+ * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
+ * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
+ * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
+ * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
+ * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: the return value of this function is forced to
+ * be higher than the maximum between the following two quantities.
+ *
+ * (a) Current time plus: (1) the maximum time for which the arrival
+ *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
+ *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
+ *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
+ *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
+ *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
+ *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
+ *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
+ *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
+ *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
+ *     batch of its requests has been completed.
+ *
+ * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
+ *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
+ *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
+ *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
+ *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
+ *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
+ *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
+ *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
+ *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
+ *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
+ *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
+ *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
+ *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
+ *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
+ *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
+ *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
+ *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
+ *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
+ *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
+ *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
+ *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
+ *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
+ *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
+ *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
+ *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
+ *
+ * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
+ * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
+ * application, if the reference quantity was just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
+ *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
+ *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
+ *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
+ *    is rather lower than the exact value.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
+ * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
+ * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite
+ * precise also in embedded systems and KVM/QEMU virtual machines.

+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()). In particular, if bfqq is being
+	 * weight-raised, it is important to idle only if there are
+	 * other, non-weight-raised queues that may steal throughput
+	 * to bfqq. Actually, we should be even more precise, and
+	 * differentiate between interactive weight raising and
+	 * soft real-time weight raising.
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+	 * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible
+	 * to let requests be served in the desired order until all
+	 * the requests already queued in the device have been served.

+ *  thinkpad_ec.c - ThinkPad embedded controller LPC3 functions
+ *
+ *  The embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard interface,

+ *  0x1600-0x161F and implements (a special case of) the H8S LPC protocol.
+ *  The EC LPC interface provides various system management services (currently

+ *  provides access and mutual exclusion for the EC interface.
+*
+ *  The LPC protocol and terminology are documented here:

+ *  tp_smapi.c - ThinkPad SMAPI support
+ *
+ *  This driver exposes some features of the System Management Application
+ *  Program Interface (SMAPI) BIOS found on ThinkPad laptops. It works on
+ *  models in which the SMAPI BIOS runs in SMM and is invoked by writing
+ *  to the APM control port 0xB2.
+ *  It also exposes battery status information, obtained from the ThinkPad
+ *  embedded controller (via the thinkpad_ec module).
+ *  Ancient ThinkPad models use a different interface, supported by the
+ *  "thinkpad" module from "tpctl".
+ *
+ *  Many of the battery status values obtained from the EC simply mirror
+ *  values provided by the battery's Smart Battery System (SBS) interface, so
+ *  their meaning is defined by the Smart Battery Data Specification (see
+ *  http://sbs-forum.org/specs/sbdat110.pdf). References to this SBS spec
+ *  are given in the code where relevant.

+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+                            NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

+exfat-nofuse
+============
+
+Linux non-fuse read/write kernel driver for the exFAT, FAT12, FAT16 and vfat (FAT32) file systems.<br />
+Originally ported from Android kernel v3.0.
+
+Kudos to ksv1986 for the mutex patch!<br />
+Thanks to JackNorris for being awesome and providing the clear_inode() patch.<br />
+<br />
+Big thanks to lqs for completing the driver!<br />
+Big thanks to benpicco for fixing 3.11.y compatibility!
+
+
+Special thanks to github user AndreiLux for spreading the word about the leak!<br />
+
+
+Installing as a stand-alone module:
+====================================
+
+    make
+    sudo make install
+
+To load the driver manually, run this as root:
+
+    modprobe exfat
+
+You may also specify custom toolchains by using CROSS_COMPILE flag, in my case:
+>CROSS_COMPILE=../dorimanx-SG2-I9100-Kernel/android-toolchain/bin/arm-eabi-
+
+Installing as a part of the kernel:
+======================================
+
+Let's take [linux] as the path to your kernel source dir...
+
+	cd [linux]
+	cp -rvf exfat-nofuse [linux]/fs/exfat
+
+edit [linux]/fs/Kconfig
+```
+ menu "DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems"
+
+  source "fs/fat/Kconfig"
+ +source "fs/exfat/Kconfig"
+  source "fs/ntfs/Kconfig"
+  endmenu
+```
+  
+
+edit [linux]/fs/Makefile
+```
+  obj-$(CONFIG_FAT_FS)    += fat/
+ +obj-$(CONFIG_EXFAT_FS)  += exfat/
+  obj-$(CONFIG_BFS_FS)    += bfs/
+```
+
+	cd [linux]
+	make menuconfig
+
+Go to:
+> File systems > DOS/FAT/NT
+>   check exfat as MODULE (M)
+>   (437) Default codepage for exFAT
+>   (utf8) Default iocharset for exFAT
+
+> ESC to main menu
+> Save an Alternate Configuration File
+> ESC ESC
+
+build your kernel
+
+Have fun.
+
+
+Installing as a DKMS module:
+=================================
+
+You can have even more fun with exfat-nofuse by installing it as a DKMS module has the main advantage of being auto-compiled (and thus, possibly surviving) between kernel upgrades.
+
+First, get dkms. On Ubuntu this should be:
+
+	sudo apt install dkms
+
+Then copy the root of this repository to /usr/share:
+
+	sudo cp -R . /usr/src/exfat-1.2.8 (or whatever version number declared on dkms.conf is)
+	sudo dkms add -m exfat -v 1.2.8
+
+Build and load the module:
+
+	sudo dkms build -m exfat -v 1.2.8
+	sudo dkms install -m exfat -v 1.2.8
+
+Now you have a proper dkms module that will work for a long time... hopefully.
+
+
+
+Free Software for the Free Minds!

+  Copyright (C) 2011,2016 Con Kolivas.
+
+  Code based on example originally by William Pugh.
+
+Skip Lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees, as
+described in the June 1990 issue of CACM and were invented by
+William Pugh in 1987.
+
+A couple of comments about this implementation:
+The routine randomLevel has been hard-coded to generate random
+levels using p=0.25. It can be easily changed.
+
+The insertion routine has been implemented so as to use the
+dirty hack described in the CACM paper: if a random level is
+generated that is more than the current maximum level, the
+current maximum level plus one is used instead.
+
+Levels start at zero and go up to MaxLevel (which is equal to
+MaxNumberOfLevels-1).
+
+The routines defined in this file are:
+
+init: defines slnode
+
+new_skiplist: returns a new, empty list
+
+randomLevel: Returns a random level based on a u64 random seed passed to it.
+In MuQSS, the "niffy" time is used for this purpose.
+
+insert(l,key, value): inserts the binding (key, value) into l. This operation
+occurs in O(log n) time.
+
+delnode(slnode, l, node): deletes any binding of key from the l based on the
+actual node value. This operation occurs in O(k) time where k is the
+number of levels of the node in question (max 8). The original delete
+function occurred in O(log n) time and involved a search.
+
+MuQSS Notes: In this implementation of skiplists, there are bidirectional
+next/prev pointers and the insert function returns a pointer to the actual
+node the value is stored. The key here is chosen by the scheduler so as to
+sort tasks according to the priority list requirements and is no longer used
+by the scheduler after insertion. The scheduler lookup, however, occurs in
+O(1) time because it is always the first item in the level 0 linked list.
+Since the task struct stores a copy of the node pointer upon skiplist_insert,
+it can also remove it much faster than the original implementation with the
+aid of prev<->next pointer manipulation and no searching.
